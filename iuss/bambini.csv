Results showed that, for both types, the accommodation of presuppositions is associated with a biphasic N400-P600 pattern at the processing point. With definite descriptions, we observed a more clear involvement of the N400, while for change-of-state verbs the costs of accommodation were associated with a more pronounced P600. Moreover, when conveyed by change of state predicates, presuppositions seem to elicit also a P200 visible already at the trigger verb. The data nicely fit into the Linking-Updating model and support two main conclusions. First, presupposition accommodation is a sequential process unfolding through a biphasic ERP pattern presumably related to search for antecedent and discourse update. Second, the kind of presupposition trigger seems to affect the cognitive cost of presupposition accommodation at different processing times, with definite description capitalizing more on the earlier search for antecedent and change-of-state verbs capitalizing more on the later updating of the discourse mental model with the presupposed information. Overall, our findings suggest that the brain understands information taken for granted by going through a process whose time course involves several phases, differently modulated based on specific linguistic expressions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Experimental pragmatics; Linking and updating; N400; Neuropragmatics; P200; P600; Presupposition","accommodation; accuracy; adult; alpha rhythm; amplitude modulation; Article; cognition; event related potential; female; hemisphere; human; human experiment; male; neuromodulation; neurophysiology; normal human; prediction; priority journal; satisfaction; semantics; stimulus response; task performance","Amaral P., Cummins C., A cross-linguistic study on information backgrounding and presupposition projection, Experimental perspectives on presuppositions, pp. 157-172, (2015); Arnold J.E., Wasow T., Losongco A., Heaviness vs. newness: The effects of structural complexity and discourse status on constituent ordering, Language, 76, pp. 28-55, (2000); Baayen R.H., Davidson D.J., Bates D.M., Mixed-effects modelling with crossed random effects for subjects and items, Journal of Memory and Language, 59, 4, pp. 390-412, (2008); Baayen R.H., Milin P., Analyzing reaction times, International Journal of Psychological Research, 3, 2, pp. 12-28, (2010); Bambini V., Bertini C., Schaeken W., Stella A., Di Russo F., Disentangling metaphor from context: An ERP study, Frontiers in Psychology, 7, (2016); Bambini V., Resta D., Metaphor and experimental pragmatics: When theory meets empirical investigation, Humana.

Several instruments are available for English. One of the most recent is the Communication Outcome after Stroke scale for patients (COAST) and caregivers (Carer COAST). These scales are comprised of two components, interactive communication skills and their impact on quality of life, assessed through 20 question items, from the point of view of patient and carer. In contrast, the number of tools available in Italian is very limited. Aims: (i) To validate the COAST and Carer COAST scales for the Italian-speaking population; (ii) to explore the applicability of the COAST scales to a wider range of people with communication problems, not limited to moderate aphasia; (iii) to explore the agreement between patient’s and carer’s perspective on communication difficulties, and the effect of severity. Methods&Procedures: The scales were translated into Italian and adapted for the sociocultural context, preserving the accessible presentation and response format. Thirty people with a history of aphasia (from mild to severe) and 28 caregivers provided usable data. The scales’ psychometric properties were measured, along with exploratory analyses on the agreement between patients and carers. Outcomes& Results: The Italian versions of the COAST scales, i.e., COAST-IT and Carer COAST-IT, showed excellent internal consistency (α = 0.94 and 0.94–0.95, respectively), good test–retest reliability (ICC = 0.85 and 0.88, respectively), and indicative evidence of construct validity as judged by the correlations with measures derived from background and current Aachener Aphasia Test (AAT) scores (r ranging from 0.32 to 0.41 and from 0.47 to 0.70, respectively). The patient and caregiver scales were strongly correlated along the score range (r = 0.70–0.72) and agreement was not influenced by aphasia severity. Conclusions: The COAST-IT and Carer COAST-IT scales are practical and reliable patient- and carer-centred measures of functional communication and its impact on the quality of life, applicable to people with communication problems of different severity. These scales fill an important gap of effectiveness indicators for speech–language assessment and therapy in Italy. More generally, the results strengthen the need of complementing traditional language assessment with functional outcome measures, and considering the perspective both of people with communication difficulties and their carers. This adaptation could pave the way for cross-national sharing of functional communication assessment instruments and comparative studies. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Aphasia; carers; functional communication; patient-centred outcome measure; quality of life","adaptation; adolescent; adult; aged; aphasia; Article; carer communication outcome after stroke scale; child; clinical article; communication outcome after stroke scale; communication skill; construct validity; dementia; dysarthria; family life; female; functional assessment; functional status assessment; human; internal consistency; male; outcome assessment; psychometry; quality of life; questionnaire; social life; speech and language assessment; test retest reliability","Report of the advisory panel to the ASHA’s functional communication measures project, (1990); Arcara G., Bambini V., A test for the assessment of pragmatic abilities and cognitive substrates (APACS): Normative data and psychometric properties, Frontiers in Psychology, 7, (2016); Armstrong E., Ferguson A., Language, meaning, context, and functional communication, Aphasiology, 24, pp. 480-496, (2010); Bambini V., Neuropragmatics: A foreword, Italian Journal of Linguistics, 22, pp. 1-20, (2010); Bambini V., Bara B.G., Neuropragmatics, Handbook of pragmatics, pp. 1-21, (2012); Bambini V., Kratschmer A., Ricci I., Correlati psicolinguistici delle gradazioni epistemiche, Linguaggio e cervello–Semantica /Language and the brain–Semantics Atti del XLII Congresso Internazionale di Studi della Società di Linguistica Italiana (Pisa, SNS, 2008), 2, (2012); Blomert L., Kean M.L., Koster C., Schokker J., Amsterdam—Nijmegen everyday language test: Construction, reliability and validity, Aphasiology, 8, pp. 381-407, (1994); Bosco F.M., Angeleri R., Zuffranieri M., Bara B.G., Sacco K., Assessment battery for communication: Development of two equivalent forms, Journal of Communication Disorders, 45, pp. 290-303, (2012); Bowen A., Hesketh A., Patchick E., Young A., Davies L., Vail A., Tyrrell P., Effectiveness of enhanced communication therapy in the first four months after stroke for aphasia and dysarthria: a randomised controlled trial, BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.), 345, (2012); Bryan K.L., The right hemisphere language battery, (1995); Cappa S.F., Functional communication profile, versione italiana, Piccoli Quaderni Di Riabilitazione, 3, pp. 49-51, (1994); Cappa S.F., Ansaldo A.I., Durand E., Rehabilitation for aphasia, Textbook of neural repair and rehabilitation, pp. 437-446, (2014); Cicchetti D.V., Guidelines, criteria, and rules of thumb for evaluating normed and standardized assessment instruments in psychology, Psychological Assessment, 6, pp. 284-290, (1994); Code C., The quantity of life for people with chronic aphasia, Neuropsychological Rehabilitation, 13, pp. 379-390, (2003); Cruice M., Worrall L., Hickson L., Murison R., Measuring quality of life: Comparing family members’ and friends’ ratings with those of their aphasic partners, Aphasiology, 19, pp. 111-129, (2005); de Carvalho I.A.M., Mansur L.L., Validation of ASHA FACS-functional assessment of communication skills for Alzheimer disease population, Alzheimer Disease & Associated Disorders, 22, pp. 375-381, (2008); de Jong-Hagelstein M., Kros L., Lingsma H.F., Dippel D.W.J., Koudstaal P.J., Visch-Brink E.G., Expert versus proxy rating of verbal communicative ability of people with aphasia after stroke, Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society: JINS, 18, pp. 1064-1070, (2012); Douglas J.M., O'Flaherty C.A., Snow P.C., Measuring perception of communicative ability: The development and evaluation of the La Trobe communication questionnaire, Aphasiology, 14, pp. 251-268, (2000); Eadie T.L., Yorkston K.M., Klasner E.R., Dudgeon B.J., Deitz J.C., Baylor C.R., Amtmann D., Measuring communicative participation: A review of self-report instruments in speech-language pathology, American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology, 15, pp. 307-320, (2006); Frattali C.M., Measuring outcomes in speech-language pathology, (1998); Frattali C.M., Thompson C.M., Holland A.L., Wohl C.B., Ferketic M.M., ASHA functional assessment of communication skills for adults (FACS).

However, this claim is mostly based on assessments of discourse production, neglecting another relevant pragmatic aspect, namely the comprehension of figurative expressions such as idioms, metaphors, and proverbs. Accounts developed in the framework of Relevance Theory might help framing an investigation in this domain, by describing a continuum of loose uses for idioms and metaphors and the echoing of general wisdom in proverbs. Aims: First, we aimed at sketching a detailed pragmatic profile of individuals with TBI, by using the Assessment of Pragmatic Abilities and Cognitive Substrates (APACS) test, a standardized tool evaluating both production and comprehension. Second, we aimed at doing a fine-grained investigation of figurative language comprehension skills, by taking into account different figurative types and task-related issues. Methods and Procedures: Thirty-nine individuals with TBI were administered the APACS test and compared to a sample of matched controls. Six subtasks considering three figurative types (idioms, metaphors, and proverbs) in two response-formats (multiple-choice and verbal explanation) were derived from the APACS test and analyzed with a mixed model approach. Outcomes and Results: Results showed a diffuse pragmatic language disorder both in the expressive and receptive modality, with 56% of individuals with TBI performing below normative cut-off in the APACS Total score. The analysis of the figurative language subtasks confirmed the difficulties of the TBI group with figurative expressions compared to controls. A further model restricted to the TBI group showed that verbal explanation was more difficult than the multiple-choice format. However, we did not observe robust differences between figurative types. The only noticeable effect was related to proverbs in the verbal explanation format, which were more difficult than all other subtasks. Conclusions: This study shows two main aspects. First, the pragmatic language disorder of people with TBI encompasses not only the well-known difficulties in discourse production but also a disruption of figurative language understanding. Second, such a disruption affects different figurative types, indicating a general problem in inferring the speaker’s meaning from non-literal language. Relevance-theoretic considerations helped us highlighting the commonalities across figurative types, rather than the differences, and the enhanced meta-representational efforts linked to proverbs in open response formats. Intervention could capitalize on these findings and implement training programs that target pragmatic inferences across different types of expressions to promote the most successful return to communication in its variety of situations. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","APACS; cognitive-communication disorder; figurative language; Pragmatic language disorder; Relevance Theory","Abstraction Test; accuracy; adolescent; adult; aged; aphasia; Article; Assessment of Pragmatic Abilities and Cognitive Substrate; clinical article; clock drawing test; cognition assessment; comprehension; controlled study; Esame Neuropsicologico Breve 2; executive function; female; Figurative language assessment; human; interpersonal communication; language; language disability; male; neuropsychological test; Phonemic Fluency; Pragmatic assessment; scoring system; speech and language assessment; task performance; theoretical study; token test; trail making test; traumatic brain injury","Adamczyk P., Daren A., Sulecka A., Bladzinski P., Cichocki L., Kalisz A., Cechnicki A., Do better communication skills promote sheltered employment in schizophrenia?, Schizophrenia Research, 176, pp. 331-339, (2016); Angeleri R., Bosco F.M., Zettin M., Sacco K., Colle L., Bara B.G., Communicative impairment in traumatic brain injury: A complete pragmatic assessment, Brain and Language, 107, pp. 229-245, (2008); Arcara G., Bambini V., A test for the assessment of pragmatic abilities and cognitive substrates (APACS): Normative data and psychometric properties, Frontiers in Psychology, 7, (2016); Baayen R.H., Analyzing linguistic data: A practical introduction to statistics.  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, (2008); Bambini V., Arcara G., Bechi M., Buonocore M., Cavallaro R., Bosia M., The communicative impairment as a core feature of schizophrenia: Frequency of pragmatic deficit, cognitive substrates, and relation with quality of life, Comprehensive Psychiatry, 71, pp. 106-120, (2016); Bambini V., Arcara G., Martinelli I., Bernini S., Alvisi E., Moro A., Ceroni M., Communication and pragmatic breakdowns in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients, Brain and Language, 153-154, pp. 1-12, (2016); Bambini V., Bertini C., Schaeken W., Stella A., Di Russo F., Disentangling metaphor from context: An ERP study, Frontiers in Psychology, 7, (2016); Bambini V., Ghio M., Moro A., Schumacher P.B., Differentiating among pragmatic uses of words through timed sensicality judgments, Frontiers in Psychology, 4, (2013); Bates D.M., Kliegl R., Vasishth S., Baayen H., Parsimonious mixed models, ArXiv Preprint ArXiv:1506.04967, pp. 1-27, (2015); Bates D.M., Machler M., Bolker B.M., Walker S.C., Fitting linear mixed-effects models using lme4, Journal of Statistical Software, 67, pp. 1-48, (2015); Benjamini Y., Hochberg Y., Controlling the false discovery rate: A practical and powerful approach to multiple testing, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

The scalar term 'some' can be interpreted pragmatically, 'Not all elephants have trunks,' or logically, 'Some and possibly all elephants have trunks.' Literature indicates that adults with ASD show no real difficulty in interpreting scalar implicatures, i.e., they often interpret them pragmatically, as controls do. This contrasts with the traditional claim of difficulties of people with ASD in other pragmatic domains, and is more in line with the idea that pragmatic problems are not universal. The aim of this study was to: (a) gain insight in the ability of children with ASD to derive scalar implicatures, and (b) do this by assessing not only sensitivity to underinformativeness, but also different degrees of tolerance to violations of informativeness. We employed a classic statement-evaluation task, presenting optimal, logical false, and underinformative utterances. In Experiment 1, children had to express their judgment on a binary option 'I agree' vs. 'I disagree.' In Experiment 2, a ternary middle answer option 'I agree a bit' was also available. Sixty-six Flemish-speaking 10-year-old children were tested: 22 children with ASD, an IQ-matched group, and an age-matched group. In the binary judgment task, the ASD group gave more pragmatic answers than the other groups, which was significant in the mixed effects logistic regression analysis, although not in the non-parametric analysis. In the ternary judgment task, the children with ASD showed a dichotomized attitude toward the speaker's meaning, by tending to either fully agree or fully disagree with underinformative statements, in contrast with TD children, who preferred the middle option. Remarkably, the IQ-matched group exhibited the same pattern of results as the ASD group. Thanks to a fine-grained measure such as the ternary judgment task, this study highlighted a neglected aspect of the pragmatic profile of ASD, whose struggle with social communication seems to affect also the domain of informativeness. We discuss the implications of the dichotomized reaction toward violations of informativeness in terms of the potential role of ASD and of cognitive and verbal abilities. © 2018 Schaeken, Van Haeren and Bambini.","Autism spectrum disorder; Experimental pragmatics; Informativeness; Pragmatic tolerance; Pragmatics; Scalar implicature","","Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-5, (2013); Andres-Roqueta C., Katsos N., The contribution of grammar, vocabulary and theory of mind in pragmatic language competence in children with autistic spectrum disorders, Front.

However, the relationship between pragmatic abilities, other language skills, and socio-cognitive aspects such as mentalizing is still a matter of wide debate. This study sets out to investigate the status of pragmatic abilities by testing from a developmental angle their relationship with other linguistic skills and mentalizing. We examined the role of structural language and mentalizing on both expressive pragmatic and prosodic skills in typically developing preschool children. A total of 105 3-to 4-year-old children were assessed on pragmatics and prosody with the Audiovisual Pragmatic Test, as well as on structural language skills (vocabulary and syntax) and a series of mentalizing measures (false belief, emotion understanding, and metacognitive vocabulary). A combined approach including correlations, regressions, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was used. Structural language was a strong positive predictor of both pragmatic and prosodic scores, while mentalizing predicted neither pragmatic nor prosodic performance. We suggest that in preschool years, expressive pragmatics and prosodic skills are more closely related to structural language skills than to mentalizing. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","Agostoni G., Bambini V., Bechi M., Buonocore M., Spangaro M., Repaci F., Cocchi F., Bianchi L., Guglielmino C., Sapienza J., Cavallaro R., Bosia M., Communicative-pragmatic abilities mediate the relationship between cognition and daily functioning in schizophrenia, Neuropsychology, 35, 1, pp. 42-56, (2021);

However, little is known about older adults’ humor understanding and the role of the cognitive skills underpinning social communication, mainly pragmatics and theory of mind (ToM). To fill this gap, we created the Phonological and Mental Jokes (PMJ) task, a fine-grained task distinguishing two types of jokes based on the mentalistic load. The PMJ task was administered, together with the Assessment of Pragmatic Abilities and Cognitive Substrates (APACS) test for pragmatics and the Strange Stories for ToM, to 147 older adults (age-range 60–85). Through structural equation modeling (SEM), we analyzed: i) the latent structure of the PMJ task; ii) the relationships between humor comprehension, pragmatics, and ToM, controlling for other background variables (vocabulary, education, and age). Results revealed a two-latent-factor model for the PMJ task, which separated phonological from mental jokes. Furthermore, pragmatic skills predicted humor comprehension irrespective of the type of joke, whereas the relationship between humor understanding and ToM skills was specific, being significant for mental, but not for phonological, jokes. These results suggest that humor understanding is part of the larger pragmatic competence of older adults and that it may additionally tax ToM skills when reasoning about the mental states of the joke’s characters is required. These findings pave the way to a lifespan consideration of humor in social communication and add to the debate over the relationship between pragmatics and ToM, showing the different role of these abilities in humor. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Aging; Experimental pragmatics; Jokes; Mindreading; Social communication; Theory of mind","","Airenti G., Playing with expectations: A contextual view of humor development, Frontiers in Psychology, 7, (2016); Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, American Psychiatric Association, (2013); Arcara G., Bambini V., A test for the assessment of pragmatic abilities and cognitive substrates (APACS): Normative data and psychometric properties, Frontiers in Psychology, 7, (2016); Attardo S., Violation of conversational maxims and cooperation: The case of jokes, Journal of Pragmatics, 19, 6, pp. 537-558, (1993); Attardo S., Linguistic theories of humor, (1994); Attardo S., Semantics and pragmatics of humor, Lang & Ling Compass, 2, 6, pp. 1203-1215, (2008); Attardo S., Raskin V., Script theory revis(it)ed: Joke similarity and joke representation model, Humor International Journal of Humor Research, 4, 3-4, pp. 293-348, (1991); Attardo S., Hempelmann C.F., Di Maio S., Script oppositions and logical mechanisms: Modeling incongruities and their resolutions, Humor - International Journal of Humor Research, 15, 1, pp. 3-46, (2002); Azim E., Jo B., Menon V., Mobbs D., Reiss A.L., Sex differences in brain activation elicited by humor, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 102, 45, pp. 16496-16501, (2005); Bambini V., Trevisan M., EsploraCoLFIS: Un’interfaccia web per ricerche sul Corpus e Lessico di Frequenza dell’Italiano Scritto, Quaderni Del Laboratorio Di Linguistica Della Scuola Normale Superiore, 11, pp. 1-16, (2012); Bambini V., Arcara G., Bechi M., Buonocore M., Cavallaro R., Bosia M., The communicative impairment as a core feature of schizophrenia: Frequency of pragmatic deficit, cognitive substrates, and relation with quality of life, Comprehensive Psychiatry, 71, pp. 106-120, (2016); Barrick A.L., Hutchinson R.L., Deckers L.H., Humor, aggression, and aging, The Gerontologist, 30, 5, pp. 675-678, (1990); Bertinetto P.M., Burani C., Laudanna A., Marconi L., Ratti D., Rolando C., & Thornton, (2005); Bosco F.M., Tirassa M., Gabbatore I., Why pragmatics and theory of mind do not (completely) overlap, Frontiers in Psychology, 9, (2018); Bozikas V.P., Kosmidis M.H., Giannakou M., Anezoulaki D., Petrikis P., Fokas K., Karavatos A., Humor appreciation deficit in schizophrenia: The relevance of basic neurocognitive functioning, The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 195, 4, pp. 325-331, (2007); Brown T., Confirmatory factor analysis for applied research, (2015); Brownell H.H., Michel D., Powelson J., Gardner H., Surprise but not coherence: Sensitivity to verbal humor in right-hemisphere patients, Brain and Language, 18, 1, pp. 20-27, (1983); Canal P., Bischetti L., Di Paola S., Bertini C., Ricci I., Bambini V., ‘Honey, shall I change the baby?

These needs become especially challenging when assessing language and communication skills, for which few tools exist. This work aimed to develop and evaluate the psychometric properties of a novel test for the rapid and tele-assessment of pragmatic skills in Italian-speaking individuals, including an alternate form to allow for monitoring and follow-up. Inspired by Gricean pragmatics and modelled after the already validated Assessment of Pragmatic Abilities and Cognitive Substrates (APACS) in-person test, the new APACS Brief Remote test includes 18 original items assessing discourse and non-literal language understanding in expressive and receptive modalities. The test lasts approximately 10 min and is suited for videoconference administration. Results from a sample of 141 healthy participants indicate that both reliability (internal consistency, test-retest, and inter-rater) and validity (measured via APACS and verbal and cognitive tests) of the APACS Brief Remote are adequate. The alternate form of the test can be considered as equivalent. Among demographic variables, the analysis highlighted especially the role of age. Perceived experience with the videoconference administration was positive, supporting the feasibility of APACS Brief Remote across ages and educational levels. The APACS Brief Remote represents a useful tool to promote evidence-based tele-assessment practices in the domain of pragmatics, for instance for online follow-up assessment, in a vast range of clinical conditions that might cause communicative difficulties. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","APACS; Pragmatic impairment; Pragmatics; Tele-neuropsychology","","Agostoni G., Bambini V., Bechi M., Buonocore M., Spangaro M., Repaci F., Cocchi F., Bianchi L., Guglielmino C., Sapienza J., Cavallaro R., Bosia M., Communicative-pragmatic abilities mediate the relationship between cognition and daily functioning in schizophrenia, Neuropsychology, 35, 1, pp. 42-56, (2021); Aiello E.N., Esposito A., Pucci V., Mondini S., Bolognini N., Appollonio I., Italian telephone-based Mini-Mental State Examination (Itel-MMSE): Item-level psychometric properties, Aging Clinical and Experimental Research, 34, 6, pp. 1259-1265, (2022); Alduais A., Majorano M., Andres-Roqueta C., Hamaguchi P., Persici V., Qasem F., Conceptualizing, defining, and assessing pragmatic language impairment in clinical settings: A scoping review, Infant and Child Development, 31, 6, (2022); Alegret M., Espinosa A., Ortega G., Perez-Cordon A., Sanabria A., Hernandez I., Marquie M., Rosende-Roca M., Mauleon A., Abdelnour C., Vargas L., de Antonio E.E., Lopez-Cuevas R., Tartari J.P., Alarcon-Martin E., Tarraga L., Ruiz A., Boada M., Valero S., From Face-to-face to Home-to-Home: Validity of a Teleneuropsychological Battery, Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease, 81, 4, pp. 1541-1553, (2021); Andres-Roqueta C., Katsos N., The contribution of grammar, vocabulary and theory of mind in pragmatic Language competence in children with autistic spectrum disorders, Frontiers in Psychology, 8, (2017); Angeleri R., Bosco F.M., Gabbatore I., Bara B.G., Sacco K., Assessment battery for communication (ABaCo): Normative data, Behavior Research Methods, 44, 3, pp. 845-861, (2012); Arcara G., Bambini V., A test for the Assessment of pragmatic abilities and cognitive substrates (APACS): Normative data and Psychometric Properties, Frontiers in Psychology, 7, (2016); Bambini V., Ghio M., Moro A., Schumacher P.B., Differentiating among pragmatic uses of words through timed sensicality judgments, Frontiers in Psychology, 4, (2013); Bambini V., Arcara G., Bechi M., Buonocore M., Cavallaro R., Bosia M., The communicative impairment as a core feature of schizophrenia: Frequency of pragmatic deficit, cognitive substrates, and relation with quality of life, Comprehensive Psychiatry, 71, pp. 106-120, (2016); Bambini V., Arcara G., Martinelli I., Bernini S., Alvisi E., Moro A., Cappa S.F., Ceroni M., Communication and pragmatic breakdowns in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients, Brain and Language, 153-154, pp. 1-12, (2016); Bambini V., Arcara G., Aiachini B., Cattani B., Dichiarante M.L., Moro A., Cappa S.F., Pistarini C., Assessing functional communication: Validation of the italian versions of the communication outcome after stroke (COAST) scales for speakers and caregivers, Aphasiology, 31, 3, pp. 332-358, (2017); Bambini V., Bischetti L., Bonomi C.G., Arcara G., Lecce S., Ceroni M., Beyond the motor account of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Verbal humour and its relationship with the cognitive and pragmatic profile, International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders, 55, 5, pp. 751-764, (2020); Bambini V., Tonini E., Ceccato I., Lecce S., Marocchini E., Cavallini E., How to improve social communication in aging: Pragmatic and cognitive interventions, Brain and Language, 211, (2020); Bambini V., Van Looy L., Demiddele K., Schaeken W., What is the contribution of executive functions to communicative-pragmatic skills?

Here we used a semiautomated multidimensional linguistic analysis innovatively combined with a machine-driven clustering technique to characterize the speech of 67 individuals with schizophrenia. Clusters were then compared for psychopathological, cognitive, and functional characteristics. We identified two subgroups with distinctive linguistic profiles: one with higher fluency, lower lexical variety but greater use of psychological lexicon; the other with reduced fluency, greater lexical variety but reduced psychological lexicon. The former cluster was associated with lower symptoms and better quality of life, pointing to the existence of specific language profiles, which also show clinically meaningful differences. These findings highlight the importance of considering language disturbances in schizophrenia as multifaceted and approaching them in automated and data-driven ways. © 2022, The Author(s).","","atypical antipsychotic agent; neuroleptic agent; adult; Article; cognition; controlled study; disorientation; female; human; human relation; k means clustering; language; language disability; linguistics; major clinical study; male; personal autonomy; Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; principal component analysis; psychological aspect; psychopharmacotherapy; quality of life; schizophrenia; social cognition; speech; speech analysis; symptom; theory of mind; unsupervised machine learning; verbal memory","Bambini V., Et al., The communicative impairment as a core feature of schizophrenia: Frequency of pragmatic deficit, cognitive substrates, and relation with quality of life, Compr.

A crucial region for pragmatics is the temporo-parietal junction, in particular the so-called Geschwind's area (GA), which is involved in high-level language processes, including the comprehension of narratives, metaphor, and irony. We evaluated the relationship between pragmatic abilities, measured through the Assessment of Pragmatic Abilities and Cognitive Substrates (APACS) test, and the functional connectivity (FC) of the bilateral GAs, assessed through a seed-based analysis of Resting-State fMRI in patients with MS. A positive correlation was observed between APACS scores and the FC for both the right and the left GA and the paracingulate cortex. Our findings suggest that the brain FC for social communication involves connections extending over both hemispheres, including right and left GAs and right and left paracingulate cortex, possibly impaired in patients with MS. This study offers preliminary evidence for future researches enrolling also a control sample to explore the involvement of GA in pragmatics in neurological disorders as well as in healthy conditions. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Functional connectivity;

The study rationale is two-fold: on the one hand, the large-scale network model as emerging in cognitive neuroscience led us to a consideration of metaphor as supported by a distributed and bilateral network; on the other hand, we based on the accounts of figurative language put forward in pragmatics and cognitive science to postulate a decomposition of such a network into multiple sub-systems. During scanning, participants implicitly processed metaphorical (familiar and unfamiliar) and non-metaphorical passages, while being explicitly involved in an adjective matching task to be performed after reading the target passages. Several regions showed greater activity to metaphors as compared to non-metaphors, including left and right inferior frontal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, left angular gyrus, and anterior cingulate. This pattern of activations, markedly bilateral, can be decomposed into circumscribed functional sub-systems mediating different aspects of metaphor resolution, as foreseen in the pragmatic and cognitive literature: (a) the conceptual/pragmatic machinery in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus and in the left angular gyrus, which supports the integration of linguistic material and world knowledge in context; (b) the attentional component in the anterior cingulate and prefrontal areas, which is set to monitor and filter for the relevant aspects of context and for the appropriate meanings; (c) the Theory of Mind system along the right superior temporal sulcus, which deals with the recognition of speakers' communicative intentions and is more extensively activated by unfamiliar metaphors. The results have several implications for the field of neuropragmatics, especially on the neuropsychological side and on the right hemisphere hypothesis. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","FMRI; Metaphor; Neuropragmatics; Pragmatics; Right hemisphere","Adult; Brain; Cognition; Comprehension; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Female; Functional Laterality; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Metaphor; Nerve Net; Nervous System Physiological Phenomena; Photic Stimulation; Psycholinguistics; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time; Reading; Recognition (Psychology); Theory of Mind; Young Adult; adult; angular gyrus; anterior cingulate; article; brain function; cognition; comprehension; decomposing metaphor processing; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; image analysis; inferior frontal gyrus; information processing; language processing; linguistics; male; mental task; nerve cell network; normal human; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; superior temporal gyrus; superior temporal sulcus; task performance","Ahrens K., Liu H., Lee C., Gong S., Fang S., Hsu Y., Functional MRI of conventional and anomalous metaphors in Mandarin Chinese, Brain Lang., 100, pp. 163-171, (2007); Amanzio M., Geminiani G., Leotta D., Cappa S., Metaphor comprehension in Alzheimer's disease: novelty matters, Brain Lang., 107, pp. 1-10, (2008); Annaz D., Van Herwegen J., Thomas M., Fishman R., Karmiloff-Smith A., Rundblad G., Comprehension of metaphor and metonymy in children with Williams syndrome, Int.

Grounding in theoretical pragmatics, we developed a novel metaphor comprehension training (MetaCom) for school-age children that focuses on inferential and contextual aspects of metaphors. The effects of the MetaCom were tested against a control training focusing on text comprehension in a randomized controlled trial involving 55 children aged between 8;8 and 9;8. Only children in the MetaCom group improved in the ability to verbally explain the meaning of a metaphor. Moreover, only the MetaCom showed transfer effects to reading comprehension. These findings suggest that targeting inference and attention to context is key to promote metaphor understanding, and that the benefits might extend to linguistic and communicative skills at large. The MetaCom training can thus represent a promising tool for educational programs, possibly also in atypical populations. © The Author(s) 2022.","experimental pragmatics; figurative language; Metaphor; pragmatics; relevance theory; training","","Baayen R.H., Analyzing linguistic data: A practical introduction to statistics using R, (2008); Bambini V., Ghio M., Moro A., Schumacher P.B., Differentiating among pragmatic uses of words through timed sensicality judgments, Frontiers in Psychology, 4, (2013); Bambini V., Tonini E., Ceccato I., Lecce S., Marocchini E., Cavallini E., How to improve social communication in aging: Pragmatic and cognitive interventions, Brain and Language, 211, (2020); Bambini V., Bott L., Schumacher P.B., It is not always a matter of time: Addressing the costs of metaphor and metonymy through a speed-accuracy trade-off study, Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology/Revue canadienne de psychologie expérimentale, 75, 2, pp. 189-196, (2021); Bambini V., Agostoni G., Buonocore M., Tonini E., Bechi M., Ferri I., Sapienza J., Martini F., Cuoco F., Cocchi F., Bischetti L., Cavallaro R., Bosia M., It is time to address language disorders in schizophrenia: A RCT on the efficacy of a novel training targeting the pragmatics of communication (PragmaCom), Journal of Communication Disorders, (2022); Bates D.M., Kliegl R., Vasishth S., Baayen H., Parsimonious mixed models, arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.04967, pp. 1-27, (2015); Benjamin L., Newton C., Ebbels S., Investigating the effectiveness of idiom intervention for 9–16-year-olds with developmental language disorder, International Journal of Language & Communication Disorders, 55, 2, pp. 266-286, (2020); Bialecka-Pikul M., Teaching children to understand metaphors as a path leading to theory of mind development, European Journal of Developmental Psychology, 7, 5, pp. 529-544, (2010); Bos L.T., De Koning B.B., Wassenburg S.I., van der Schoot M., Training inference making skills using a situation model approach improves reading comprehension, Frontiers in Psychology, 7, (2016); Bowes A., Katz A., Metaphor creates intimacy and temporarily enhances theory of mind, Memory and Cognition, 43, 6, pp. 953-963, (2015); Boyce W., Torsheim T., Currie C., Zambon A., The family affluence scale as a measure of national wealth: Validation of an adolescent self-report measure, Social Indicators Research, 78, 3, pp. 473-487, (2006); Brock J., Norbury C., Einav S., Nation K., Do individuals with autism process words in context?

SNEGs belong to the class of expletive negation sentences, i.e., they are affirmative in meaning but involve a clausal negation. A clear example is offered by Italian: ‘Enonmi è scesa dal treno Maria?!’ (let. ‘and not CLITIC.to_me is got off-the train Mary’ = ‘The surprise was that Maria got off the train!’). From a theoretical point of view, the interpretation of SNEGs as affirmative can be derived from their specific syntactic and semantic structure. Here we offer an implementation of the visual world paradigm to test how SNEGs are interpreted. Participants listened to affirmative, negative or expletive negative clauses while four objects (two relevant—either expected or unexpected—and two unrelated) were shown on the screen and their eye movements were recorded. Growth Curve Analysis showed that the fixation patterns to the relevant objects were very similar for affirmative and expletive negative sentences, while striking differences were observed between negative and affirmative sentences. These results showed that negation does play a different role in the mental representation of a sentence, depending on its syntactic derivation. Moreover, we also found that, compared to affirmative sentences, SNEGs require higher processing efforts due to both their syntactic complexity and pragmatic integration, with slower response time and lower accuracy. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Expletive negation;

We examined this issue by using a short-term longitudinal design, and by distinguishing between metaphor accuracy (the ability to understand metaphors) and specificity of mental interpretation (the ability to interpret mentally mental, but not physical metaphors). We also distinguished between ToM and the ability to make inferences about physical states. 54 typically developing children (aged 8;6–9;4 years) were tested at baseline and 6 months later. Results showed that metaphor accuracy and inferential skills about physical states were bi-directionally related over time, whereas early specificity of mental interpretation predicted later ToM (and not vice versa). We conclude that: (a) metaphor comprehension and general inferential abilities develop side by side in a mutually supportive way; and (b) the tendency to mentally interpret mental metaphors is a driving factor in ToM development. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Experimental pragmatics;

While historically a main semantic deficit has been widely claimed, results are mixed, with also evidence of syntactic impairment. This might be due to heterogeneity in materials and paradigms across studies, which often do not allow to tap into single linguistic components. Moreover, the interaction between linguistic and neurocognitive deficits is still unclear. In this study, we concentrated on syntactic and semantic knowledge. We employed an anomaly detection task including short and long sentences with either syntactic errors violating the principles of Universal Grammar, or a novel form of semantic errors, resulting from a contradiction in the computation of the whole sentence meaning. Fifty-eight patients with diagnosis of schizophrenia were compared to 30 healthy subjects. Results showed that, in patients, only the ability to identify syntactic anomaly, both in short and long sentences, was impaired. This result cannot be explained by working memory abilities or psychopathological features. These findings suggest the presence of an impairment of syntactic knowledge in schizophrenia, at least partially independent of the cognitive and psychopathological profile. On the contrary, we cannot conclude that there is a semantic impairment, at least in terms of compositional semantics abilities. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Anomaly; Grammaticality judgments; Language; Schizophrenia; Semantics; Syntax","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cognition Disorders; Decision Making; Executive Function; Female; Humans; Language Disorders; Language Tests; Male; Memory, Short-Term; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Psycholinguistics; Psychomotor Performance; Reading; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenic Psychology; Semantics; Statistics, Nonparametric; Young Adult; adult; aged; Article; comprehension; controlled study; decision making; disease association; female; grammar; human; language disability; language processing; linguistics; major clinical study; male; psychologic assessment; reinforcement; schizophrenia; semantics; syntax; task performance; thought disorder; verbal memory; working memory; adolescent; Cognition Disorders; complication; executive function; Language Disorders; language test; linguistics; middle aged; neuropsychological test; nonparametric test; psychological rating scale; psychology; psychomotor performance; reading; schizophrenia; short term memory; young adult","Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR)., American Psychiatric Association, Washington D.C, (2000); Andreasen N.C., Thought, language, and communication disorders: clinical assessment, definition of terms, and assessment of their reliability, Arch.

However, recent findings suggested that it also affects cognition, especially executive functions, social cognition, language and pragmatics. A relevant issue in current research is thus the description of the cognitive phenotype of ALS and the identification of the most vulnerable aspects. Aims: The focus was on a communicative phenomenon placed at the crossroads of pragmatic and other cognitive domains, namely humour, which till now has been poorly explored in ALS. The first aim was to investigate whether ALS is associated with impairments in understanding and appreciating jokes. The second aim was to explore the predictors of humour comprehension and appreciation in patients, to confirm the involvement of pragmatic skills and to explore the role of other cognitive and clinical aspects. Methods & Procedures: A total of 30 non-demented patients with ALS and 27 controls were assessed with a task of verbal humour comprehension and appreciation, including two types of jokes: phonological and mental. We also administered a battery of pragmatic and other language tasks, and cognitive and socio-cognitive tasks. Mixed-effects models were used to test differences in the humour task between the two groups. Multiple regressions determined the best predictors of humour comprehension and appreciation in patients. Outcomes & Results: Patients obtained lower comprehension accuracy scores than controls in the humour task, independently of the type of joke. Conversely, patients and controls did not differ in joke appreciation and both rated mental jokes as funnier than the phonological ones. Patients’ comprehension accuracy was predicted by pragmatic skills and ALS severity, whereas appreciation was predicted by several clinical variables and, to a smaller extent, by language skills. Conclusions & Implications: The findings suggest that humour is a very vulnerable aspect in ALS, and that impairment in humour comprehension might be part of the larger cognitive impairment, being linked to pragmatic impairment. Clinical variables were also important, especially in relation to humour appreciation. More generally, these data speak in favour of pragmatics as a relevant aspect to sketch the cognitive phenotype of ALS. On the practical level, these findings point to the need of supporting communication at large, not only motor-related aspects such as dysarthria but also social–pragmatic aspects such as understanding jokes, to increase well-being in ALS. What this paper adds What is already known on this subject The literature of the last decades has shown that ALS comes with impairment in several cognitive domains, affecting especially executive functions as well as language. There is also initial evidence that the pragmatics of communication and humour comprehension are impaired, although non-serious talk has been documented in conversational interaction among people with ALS. What this paper adds to existing knowledge This study offers compelling evidence of an impairment in the comprehension of jokes in ALS, whereas the appreciation of joke funniness seems to be spared. The study also highlights the interplay of cognitive factors (especially pragmatics) and clinical factors (related to disease severity) in predicting the patients’ performance in the humour task. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? The study's findings call for the need of increased awareness among scholars as well as practitioners and caregivers of the profile of humour comprehension and appreciation in ALS. On a practical level, we highlight the need of assessing humour comprehension and adapting the communicative style accordingly. Second, we recommend that intervention programmes targeting communication in ALS go beyond speech-related difficulties and include pragmatic aspects such as humour. Considering the important communicative and social function of humour, as well as its use as a coping strategy, humour interventions are key to improve the quality of life of individuals with ALS. © 2020 Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists","amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; humour; neurodegenerative diseases; pragmatics","Aged; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Cognition Disorders; Comprehension; Executive Function; Female; Humans; Language Tests; Linguistics; Male; Middle Aged; Phenotype; Social Cognition; Social Communication Disorder; Verbal Behavior; Wit and Humor as Topic; aged; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; cognitive defect; communication disorder; comprehension; executive function; female; human; humor; language test; linguistics; male; middle aged; phenotype; psychology; social cognition; verbal behavior","Abell F., Happe F., Frith U., Do triangles play tricks?

However, figurative expressions are not all alike in terms of linguistic and pragmatic processes. Determining if some figurative types are more impaired than others and if the type of task affects the performance constitutes an open issue with implications for the description of the clinical profile and for treatment. We run a fine-grained assessment of figurative language comprehension by comparing 47 patients with schizophrenia and 39 controls in three figurative types (idioms, metaphors, proverbs) presented in two response formats (multiple-choice, verbal-explanation), considering also the role of cognitive and clinical variables and the impact on quality of life. Mixed-effects models analysis revealed that: i) patients performed worse than controls across figurative types and response formats, indicating a diffuse impairment; ii) there is an interplay of figurative type and response format, which makes verbal-explanation of proverbs especially challenging; iii) in patients, problems in figurative language are largely connected with formal thought disorder and global IQ. Moreover, multiple-choice of metaphors was associated with patients’ quality of life. This study offers a novel account of concretism, framed in pragmatics and figurative language processing. Adopting this perspective allowed us to describe the nuances of concretism, which areas in the figurative domain are especially challenging for patients and which ones capture differences in functioning, in order to guide intervention programs and integration in society. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Idioms; Language; Metaphor; Pragmatics; Proverbs; Psychosis","Adult; Cognitive Dysfunction; Comprehension; Female; Humans; Male; Metaphor; Middle Aged; Psychotic Disorders; Quality of Life; Schizophrenia; Speech Perception; Thinking; adult; aged; Article; clinical article; clinical feature; cognition assessment; comprehension; concretism; controlled study; female; human; intelligence quotient; language; language processing; male; multiple choice test; quality of life; schizophrenia; thought disorder; verbal explanation; cognitive defect; complication; literature; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; psychosis; schizophrenia; speech perception; thinking","Adamczyk P., Daren A., Sulecka A., Bladzinski P., Cichocki L., Kalisz A., Gaweda L., Cechnicki A., Do better communication skills promote sheltered employment in schizophrenia?, Schizophr.

Here we tested pragmatic abilities in 33 non-demented ALS patients and 33 healthy controls matched for age and education through 6 different tasks, ranging from discourse organization to the comprehension of figurative language, further grouped in three composite measures for pragmatic production, pragmatic comprehension and global pragmatic abilities. For a subgroup of patients, assessment included executive functions and social cognition skills. ALS patients were impaired on all pragmatic tasks relative to controls, with 45% of the patients performing below cut-off in at least one pragmatic task, and 36% impaired on the global pragmatic score. Pragmatic breakdowns were more common than executive deficit as defined by the consensus criteria, and approximately as prevalent as deficits in social cognition. Multiple regression analyses support the idea of an interplay of executive and social cognition abilities in determining the pragmatic performance, although all these domains show some degree of independence. These findings shed light on pragmatic impairment as a relevant dimension of ALS, which deserves further consideration in defining the cognitive profile of the disease, given its vital role for communication and social interaction in daily life. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Communication; Discourse; Metaphor; Neuropragmatics; Pragmatics; Social cognition","Adult; Aged; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Case-Control Studies; Cognition Disorders; Communication; Comprehension; Executive Function; Female; Humans; Language; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Social Behavior; adult; aged; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Article; clinical article; comprehension; controlled study; educational status; executive function; female; global pragmatic ability; human; interpersonal communication; language ability; linguistics; male; nervous system parameters; neuropsychological test; pragmatic comprehension; pragmatic production; semantics; social cognition; social interaction; task performance; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; case control study; cognitive defect; comprehension; language; middle aged; psychology; social behavior","Abrahams S., Social cognition in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Neurodegenerative Disease Management, 1, 5, pp. 397-405, (2011); Abrahams S., Executive dysfunction in ALS is not the whole story, Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry, 84, 5, pp. 474-475, (2013); Amanzio M., Geminiani G., Leotta D., Cappa S., Metaphor comprehension in Alzheimer's disease: Novelty matters, Brain and Language, 107, 1, pp. 1-10, (2008); Appollonio I., Leone M., Isella V., Piamarta F., Consoli T., Villa M.L., Nichelli P., The Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB): Normative values in an Italian population sample, Neurological Sciences: Official Journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology, 26, 2, pp. 108-116, (2005); Ash S., Menaged A., Olm C., McMillan C.T., Boller A., Irwin D.J., Grossman M., Narrative discourse deficits in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Neurology, 83, 6, pp. 520-528, (2014); Ash S., Moore P., Antani S., McCawley G., Work M., Grossman M., Trying to tell a tale: Discourse impairments in progressive aphasia and frontotemporal dementia, Neurology, 66, 9, pp. 1405-1413, (2006); Ash S., Olm C., McMillan C.T., Boller A., Irwin D.J., McCluskey L., Grossman M., Deficits in sentence expression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis & Frontotemporal Degeneration, (2014); Baayen R.H., Analyzing linguistic data a practical introduction to statistics using R, (2008); Bak T.H., Chandran S., What wires together dies together: Verbs, actions and neurodegeneration in motor neuron disease, Cortex; a Journal Devoted to the Study of the Nervous System and Behavior, 48, 7, pp. 936-944, (2012); Bak T.H., Hodges J.R., The effects of motor neurone disease on language: Further evidence, Brain and Language, 89, 2, pp. 354-361, (2004); Bambini V., Neuropragmatics: A foreword, Italian Journal of Linguistics, 22, 1, pp. 1-20, (2010); Bambini V., Bara B.G., Neuropragmatics, Handbook of pragmatics, pp. 1-21, (2012); Bambini V., Ghio M., Moro A., Schumacher P.B., Differentiating among pragmatic uses of words through timed sensicality judgments, Frontiers in Psychology, 4, DECEMBER, (2013); Bennion Callister J., Pickering-Brown S.M., Pathogenesis/genetics of frontotemporal dementia and how it relates to ALS, Experimental Neurology, 262, pp. 84-90, (2014); Blain-Briere B., Bouchard C., Bigras N., The role of executive functions in the pragmatic skills of children age 4-5, Frontiers in Psychology, 5, MARCH, (2014); Blair R.J., Cipolotti L., Impaired social response reversal.

This experimental design was chosen to compare two conflicting theoretical positions on this topic. The indirect access account claims that literal aspects are processed first, and additional meaning components are computed only if no satisfactory interpretation is reached. In contrast, the direct access approach argues that figurative aspects can be accessed immediately. We presented metaphors (These lawyers are hyenas, Experiment 1a and 1b) and producer-for-product metonymies (The boy read Böll, Experiment 2a and 2b) with and without a prime word that was semantically relevant to the literal meaning of the target word (furry and talented, respectively). In the presentation without priming, metaphors revealed a biphasic N400-Late Positivity pattern, while metonymies showed an N400 only. We interpret the findings within a two-phase language architecture where contextual expectations guide initial access (N400) and precede pragmatic adjustment resulting in reconceptualization (Late Positivity). With masked priming, the N400-difference was reduced for metaphors and vanished for metonymies. This speaks against the direct access view that predicts a facilitating effect for the literal condition only and hence would predict the N400-difference to increase. The results are more consistent with indirect access accounts that argue for facilitation effects for both conditions and consequently for consistent or even smaller N400-amplitude differences. This combined masked priming ERP paradigm therefore yields new insights into the role of literal meaning in the online composition of figurative language. © 2014 Weiland, Bambini and Schumacher.","Experimental pragmatics; Late positivity; Literal meaning; Masked priming; Metaphor; Metonymy; N400","accuracy; adult; article; comprehension; controlled study; event related potential; facilitation; female; human; human experiment; language processing; linguistics; literal meaning; male; response time; task performance; word recognition","Arzouan Y., Goldstein A., Faust M., Brainwaves are stethoscopes: ERP correlates of novel metaphor comprehension, Brain Res, 1160, pp. 69-81, (2007); Asher N., Lexical Meaning In Context: A Web of Words, (2011); Bambini V., Bara B.G., Neuropragmatics, Handbook of Pragmatics, pp. 1-21, (2012); Bambini V., Gentili C., Ricciardi E., Bertinetto P.M., Pietrini P., Decomposing metaphor processing at the cognitive and neural level through functional magnetic resonance imaging, Brain Res.

While theoretical linguistics has largely described the phenomenon of presupposition, there is little empirical investigation, mainly from behavioural studies. Here we employed the Event Related Potential (ERP) technique to search for the brain signature of presupposition as opposed to assertion in discourse. Based on theoretical accounts, we hypothesized that presupposing new information should elicit higher efforts due to the mismatch between the information packaging and the actual knowledge, and to the need of accommodating the presupposed content in the mental model of discourse. We also hypothesized that these efforts could reflect in enhanced N400, similarly to other mechanisms operating at the discourse-context level. Twenty-seven participants were presented with passages containing new information packaged either as presupposition or as assertion. Two types of presupposition triggers were selected: definite descriptions and temporal subordinate clauses. Results evidenced a difference between the processing of presuppositions and that of assertions, reflected in a more enhanced N400 for the former. Results also showed that the temporal development of the presupposition effect is earlier for subordinate clauses than for definite descriptions. Differently from some behavioural studies on presupposition, but consistently with the theoretical literature and with other ERP studies on discourse processing, our data offer the first neurophysiological evidence that presupposition is more costly than assertion when new information is presented, with differences in the time development of the effect across trigger types. We proposed to account for the N400 effect induced by new presuppositions as stemming from a pragmatic “garden path” effect, in that, being presented with a new presupposition, the receiver is led down a mismatch between information packaging and discourse representation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Discourse; Experimental pragmatics; Information structure; N400; Neuropragmatics","","Abbott B., Presuppositions as non assertions, Journal of Pragmatics, 32, pp. 1419-1437, (2000); Abusch D., Lexical alternatives as source of pragmatic presuppositions, Proceedings of SALT XII, (2002); Altmann G.T.M., Anticipating the garden path: The horse raced past the barn ate the cake, Language down the garden path: The cognitive and biological basis for linguistic structure, pp. 111-130, (2013); Bambini V., Neuropragmatics: A foreword, Italian Journal of Linguistics, 22, 1, pp. 1-20, (2010); Bambini V., Bara B., Neuropragmatics, Handbook of pragmatics, pp. 1-22, (2012); Bambini V., Bertini C., Schaeken W., Stella A., Di Russo F., Disentangling metaphor from context: An ERP study, Frontiers in Psychology, 7, (2016); Bambini V., Resta D., Grimaldi M., A dataset of metaphors from the Italian literature: Exploring psycholinguistic variables and the role of context, PLoS ONE, 9, (2014); Bever T.G., The cognitive basis for linguistic structures, Cognition and the development of language, pp. 279-362, (1970); Bornkessel-Schlesewsky I., Schumacher P.B., Towards a neurobiology of information structure, The oxford handbook of information structure, (2016); Burkhardt P., The P600 reflects cost of new information in discourse memory, Neuroreport, 18, 17, pp. 1851-1854, (2007); Burkhardt P., Roehm D., Differential effects of saliency: An event-related brain potential study, Neuroscience Letters, 413, pp. 115-120, (2007); Camblin C.C., Gordon P.C., Swaab T.Y., The interplay of discourse congruence and lexical association during sentence processing: Evidence from ERPs and eye tracking, Journal of Memory and Language, 56, 1, pp. 103-128, (2007); Cory B., Romoli J., Schwarz F., Crain S., Scalar implicatures vs. presuppositions: The view from acquisition, TOPOI: Presuppositions: Philosophy, Linguistics, and Psychology, 35, 1, pp. 57-71, (2016); Coulson S., Frame-shifting and frame semantics: Joke comprehension on the space structuring model, Cognitive linguistics and humor research, pp. 167-190, (2015); Delorme A., Makeig S., EEGLAB: An open source toolbox for analysis of single-trial EEG dynamics including independent component analysis, Journal of Neuroscience Methods, 134, pp. 9-21, (2004); Domaneschi F., Carrea E., Penco C., Greco A., The cognitive load of presupposition triggers: Mandatory and optional repairs in presupposition failure, Language, Cognition and Neuroscience, 29, 1, pp. 136-146, (2014); Domaneschi F., Carrea E., Penco C., Greco A., Selecting presuppositions in conditional clauses.

Yet, the remediation of such disruptions is still in its infancy. Here we targeted what is known to be one of the most damaged language domains in schizophrenia, namely pragmatics, by conducting a pragmatics-centered intervention with a randomized controlled trial design and assessing also durability and generalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study with these characteristics. Methods: Inspired by the Gricean account of natural language use, we tailored a novel treatment addressing the pragmatics of communication (PragmaCom) and we tested its efficacy in a sample of individuals with schizophrenia randomized to the experimental group or to an active control group. The primary outcome with respect to the efficacy of the PragmaCom was measured by changes in pragmatic abilities (as evaluated with the global score of the Assessment of Pragmatic Abilities and Cognitive Substrates test) from baseline to 12 weeks and at 3-month follow-up. The secondary outcome was measured by changes in metaphor comprehension, abstract thinking, and global functioning from baseline to 12 weeks and at 3-month follow-up. Results: Relative to the control group, at post-test the PragmaCom group showed greater and enduring improvement in global pragmatic skills and in metaphor comprehension. At follow-up, these improvements persisted and the PragmaCom exerted beneficial effects also on functioning. Conclusions: Despite the limited sample size, we believe that these findings offer initial yet encouraging evidence of the possibility to improve pragmatic skills with a theoretically grounded approach and to obtain durable and clinically relevant benefits. We argue that it is time that therapeutic efforts embrace communicative dysfunctions in order to improve illness outcome. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Concretism; Functioning; Metaphor; Pragmatics; Rehabilitation; Schizophrenia","Communication; Comprehension; Humans; Language; Language Disorders; Schizophrenia; neuroleptic agent; abstract thinking; adult; Article; Assessment of Pragmatic Abilities and Cognitive Substrates test; clinical article; cognitive function test; cognitive remediation therapy; comprehension; controlled study; female; follow up; human; language disability; literature; male; outcome assessment; parallel design; pragmatics of communication therapy; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; sample size; schizophrenia; single blind procedure; speech rehabilitation; therapy effect; treatment duration; interpersonal communication; language; language disability; schizophrenia","Adamczyk P., Daren A., Sulecka A., Bladzinski P., Cichocki L., Kalisz A., Cechnicki A., Do better communication skills promote sheltered employment in schizophrenia?, Schizophrenia Research, 176, 2-3, pp. 331-339, (2016); Aghotor J., Pfueller U., Moritz S., Weisbrod M., Roesch-Ely D., Metacognitive training for patients with schizophrenia (MCT): Feasibility and preliminary evidence for its efficacy, Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry, 41, 3, pp. 207-211, (2010); Agostoni G., Bambini V., Bechi M., Buonocore M., Spangaro M., Repaci F., Bosia M., Communicative-pragmatic abilities mediate the relationship between cognition and daily functioning in schizophrenia, Neuropsychology, 35, 1, pp. 42-56, (2021); (2013); Andreasen N.C., Thought, language, and communication disorders, Archives of General Psychiatry, 36, 12, pp. 1315-1321, (1979); Anselmetti S., Poletti S., Ermoli E., Bechi M., Cappa S.F., Venneri A., Cavallaro R., The brief assessment of cognition in schizophrenia.

Nowadays, it is widely acknowledged that ALS not only affects motor abilities but also comes with a range of neuropsychological impairments including language, in a strict relation with fronto-temporal dementia. Although pragmatic aspects are still largely unexplored, the available literature consistently points to the presence of pragmatic language disorder in ALS. The most documented feature of pragmatic impairment in ALS is the disruption of narrative language and discourse effectiveness. A few studies have also reported impairment in understanding non-literal language, including figurative expressions, humor and sarcasm. These difficulties cannot be fully accounted for in terms of executive function deficits or social cognition impairment and call for specific consideration. In line with this evidence, the most recent consensus criteria for the diagnosis of fronto-temporal dysfunction in ALS include pragmatics in the description of the possible profiles of cognitive impairment. Yet, ALS remains an underserved population in terms of pragmatic language disorder. We encourage future research to consider pragmatics and social communication in ALS in order to provide better clinical assessment and improved treatment for patients with the condition and their caregivers. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Assessment of Pragmatic Abilities and Cognitive Substrates (APACS); Discourse; Figurative language; Non-literal language; Pragmatics; Social communication","","Adamczyk P., Daren A., Sulecka A., Bladzinski P., Cichocki L., Kalisz A., Gaweda L., Cechnicki A., Do better communication skills promote sheltered employment in schizophrenia?, Schizophrenia Research, 176, 2-3, pp. 331-339, (2016); Alonso A., Logroscino G., Jick S.S., Hernan M.A., Incidence and lifetime risk of motor neuron disease in the United Kingdom: A population-based study, European Journal of Neurology, 16, 6, pp. 745-751, (2009); Appollonio I., Leone M., Isella V., Piamarta F., Consoli T., Villa M.L., Forapani E., Russo A., Nichelli P., The Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB): Normative values in an Italian population sample, Neurological Sciences, 26, 2, pp. 108-116, (2005); Arcara G., Bambini V., A test for the Assessment of Pragmatic Abilities and Cognitive Substrates (APACS): Normative data and psychometric properties, Frontiers in Psychology, 7, (2016); Arcara G., Tonini E., Muriago G., Mondin E., Sgarabottolo E., Bertagnoni G., Semenza C., Bambini V., Pragmatics and figurative language in individuals with traumatic brain injury: Fine-grained assessment and relevance-theoretic considerations, Aphasiology, (2019); Ash S., Menaged A., Olm C., McMillan C.T., Boller A., Irwin D.J., McCluskey L., Elman L., Grossman M., Narrative discourse deficits in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Neurology, 83, 6, pp. 520-528, (2014); Ash S., Moore P., Antani S., McCawley G., Work M., Grossman M., Trying to tell a tale: Discourse impairments in progressive aphasia and frontotemporal dementia, Neurology, 66, 9, pp. 1405-1413, (2006); Ash S., Olm C., McMillan C.T., Boller A., Irwin D.J., McCluskey L., Elman L., Grossman M., Deficits in sentence expression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration, 16, 1-2, pp. 31-39, (2015); Baggio G., Granello G., Verriello L., Eleopra R., Formal semantics in the neurology clinic: Atypical understanding of aspectual coercion in ALS patients, Frontiers in Psychology, 7, (2016); Bak T.H., Chandran S., What wires together dies together: Verbs, actions and neurodegeneration in motor neuron disease, Cortex, 48, 7, pp. 936-944, (2012); Bak T.H., Hodges J.R., Noun-verb dissociation in three patients with motor neuron disease and aphasia, Brain and Language, 60, 1, pp. 38-40, (1997); Bak T.H., Hodges J.R., The effects of motor neurone disease on language: Further evidence, Brain and Language, 89, 2, pp. 354-361, (2004); Bak T.H., O'Donovan D.G., Xuereb J.H., Boniface S., Hodges J.R., Selective impairment of verb processing associated with pathological changes in Brodmann areas 44 and 45 in the motor neurone disease–dementia–aphasia syndrome, Brain, 124, 1, pp. 103-120, (2001); Bambini V., Arcara G., Bechi M., Buonocore M., Cavallaro R., Bosia M., The communicative impairment as a core feature of schizophrenia: Frequency of pragmatic deficit, cognitive substrates, and relation with quality of life, Comprehensive Psychiatry, 71, pp. 106-120, (2016); Bambini V., Arcara G., Martinelli I., Bernini S., Alvisi E., Moro A., Cappa S.F., Ceroni M., Communication and pragmatic breakdowns in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients, Brain and Language, 153-154, 1-12, (2016); Bambini V., Bischetti L., Bonomi C., Arcara G., Lecce S., Ceroni M., (2018).

The arcuate fasciculus is a central connection in this architecture, linking regions devoted to formal aspects of language with regions involved in intentional and social communication. Here, we outline a new anatomical model of communication that incorporates previous neurofunctional accounts of language with recent advances in tractography and neuropragmatics. The model consists of five levels, from the representation of informative actions and communicative intentions, to lexical/semantic processing, syntactic analysis, and pragmatic integration. The structure of the model is hierarchical in relation to developmental and evolutionary trajectories and it may help interpreting clinico-anatomical correlation in communication disorders. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","","Animals;

However, pragmatics has never been considered as an intervention target in healthy aging. Here we tested the effects of a novel training program to improve pragmatics (PragmaCom) in older adults, compared with an active cognitive control group in a randomized-controlled-trial design. Both the PragmaCom group and the control group improved in pragmatic skills such as understanding metaphors and avoiding off-topic speech, indicating that it is possible to improve pragmatics in aging both with a specific training and with a cognitive training. Individual cognitive factors predicted pragmatic improvement in the control group, while in the PragmaCom group benefits were less dependent on individual characteristics. We discuss the results in terms of pragmatic plasticity, highlighting the importance of these findings for promoting older adults’ social communication and well-being. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Aging; Metaphor; Off-topic verbosity; Pragmatics; Social communication; Training","Aged; Aging; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Communication; Comprehension; Female; Humans; Linguistics; Male; Mental Status and Dementia Tests; Metaphor; Middle Aged; Social Interaction; aged; aging; article; controlled study; executive function; female; human; human experiment; literature; male; randomized controlled trial; skill; speech; training; wellbeing; aging; cognition; cognitive defect; comprehension; dementia assessment; interpersonal communication; linguistics; middle aged; physiology; procedures; psychology; social interaction","Agostoni G., Tonini E., Buonocore M., Bechi M., Silvestri M.P., Sapienza J., Bosia M., M51.

However, very few experiments have tackled the neurophysiological underpinnings of literary metaphor. Here we used Event-Related brain Potentials (ERPs) to explore the temporal dynamics of comprehending metaphors from Italian poems and novels (e.g., grass of velvet), presented in their original context, as compared with literal expressions (e.g., throne of velvet). Results evidence a more negative ERP response for metaphors, unfolding in an N400 followed by a sustained negativity over frontal sites, suggesting a long-lasting effort in elaborating figurative meanings. Whereas the N400 might be indicative of lexical/semantic processes typical of metaphors and amplified by the literary context, the sustained negativity might reflect the manipulation of multiple meanings in working memory, possibly responsible for the poetic effect. Interestingly, the late negativity effect is driven by familiarity, with a more negative response for those metaphors that are less familiar. These findings offer material to discuss ideas put forward in pragmatics, literary studies, and cognitive neuroscience of literature, like the condensation of weak implicatures, the foregrounding, and the relation between a metaphor and its context. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","Arzouan Y., Goldstein A., Faust M., Brainwaves are stethoscopes: ERP correlates of novel metaphor comprehension, Brain Research, 60, pp. 69-81, (2007); Baayen R.H., Davidson D.J., Bates D.M., Mixed-effects modeling with crossed random effects for subjects and items, Journal of Memory and Language, 59, pp. 390-412, (2008); Baayen R.H., Milin P., Analyzing reaction times, International Journal of Psychological Research, 3, pp. 12-28, (2010); Baggio G., Van Lambalgen M., Hagoort P., Computing and recomputing discourse models: An ERP study, Journal of Memory and Language, 52, pp. 36-53, (2008); Bambini V., Neuropragmatics: A foreword, Italian Journal of Linguistics, 22, pp. 1-20, (2010); Bambini V., Bertini C., Schaeken W., Stella A., Di Russo F., Disentangling metaphor from context: An ERP study, Frontiers in Psychology, 7, (2016); Bambini V., Gentili C., Ricciardi E., Bertinetto P.M., Pietrini P., Decomposing metaphor processing at the cognitive and neural level through functional magnetic resonance imaging, Brain Research Bulletin, 86, pp. 203-216, (2011); Bambini V., Ghio M., Moro A., Schumacher P.B., Differentiating among pragmatic uses of words through timed sensicality judgments, Frontiers in Psychology, 4, (2013); Bambini V., Resta D., Metaphor and experimental pragmatics: When theory meets empirical investigation, Humana.

Using linear mixed models on single trials we showed that humorous target words elicited a larger Left Anterior Negativity (LAN), sustained in time and followed by a positive shift involving P600 and Late Positive Complex (LPC) components. In the time-frequency domain, humor was associated with a power decrease in the beta-band of the EEG. Furthermore, participants’ Autism-spectrum Quotient correlated with the size of the LAN, suggesting that social skills may affect humor comprehension during the early processing phase. Our results describe a sequence of events where incongruity detection (associated with the LAN) precedes a composite set of mechanisms serving resolution and acting in parallel: the sustained LAN might reflect the search for an alternative script, while the P600 might index inferential processes arriving at the resolution and the updating of the discourse model. The processing differences associated with the LPC and the changes in beta power may reflect a later stage of more elaborative and reflective processing (where the receiver reflects upon the joke's solution) and the abandonment of the current discourse model. © 2019","ERP; Experimental pragmatics; Humor and jokes; Neuropragmatics; Time-frequency","Adolescent; Adult; Brain; Comprehension; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials; Female; Humans; Male; Reading; Wit and Humor as Topic; Young Adult; adult; Article; autism assessment; comprehension; controlled study; conversation; electroencephalogram; electrophysiology; emotion; event related potential; female; human; human experiment; humor; language processing; male; priority journal; questionnaire; sentence span task; social competence; stimulus response; time factor; verbal memory test; visual stimulation; working memory; adolescent; brain; electroencephalography; evoked response; physiology; reading; young adult","Attardo S., Linguistic theories of humor.

We present a qualitative, non-exhaustive, review of several empirical investigations that used EEG-based measures to investigate language processing in the pragmatic domain. Touching upon three main topics (non-literal language, discourse and conversation, and clinical populations), we present the interaction of a set of cognitive processes that exploit semantic memory or elaborate on the mental representation of the current context to derive pragmatic inferences. ERP measures provide evidence for shedding new light on longstanding debates in pragmatics (e.g., the direct vs. indirect access issue), while a pragmatic perspective provides information on the functional role of ERP components (e.g., to understand the nature of the P600 in non-syntactic contexts). © 2023, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Context;

The present longitudinal study was designed to investigate the existence and the direction of the associations between metaphor understanding and peer relationships in children. One-hundred twenty-six typically developing 9-year-old children were tested at baseline and a year later for their ability to understand metaphors (via the physical and mental metaphors task) and their peer relationships (through peer acceptance and rejection). Results showed a longitudinal and bidirectional association between metaphor understanding and peer rejection, but not peer acceptance. Children who were more rejected were less able to understand metaphors 1 year later and children who struggled in understanding metaphors were more rejected 1 year later. Results are discussed in light of existing theoretical models. Overall, these findings show that the social nature of metaphor traces back to peer relationships in children. © 2021 The Authors.

This study extends the currently available materials on everyday metaphorical expressions by providing the first dataset of metaphors extracted from literary texts and scored for the major psycholinguistic variables, considering also the effect of context. A set of 115 Italian literary metaphors presented in isolation (Experiment 1) and a subset of 65 literary metaphors embedded in their original texts (Experiment 2) were rated on several dimensions (word and phrase frequency, readability, cloze probability, familiarity, concreteness, difficulty and meaningfulness). Overall, literary metaphors scored around medium-low values on all dimensions in both experiments. Collected data were subjected to correlation analysis, which showed the presence of a strong cluster of variables-mainly familiarity, difficulty, and meaningfulness-when literary metaphor were presented in isolation. A weaker cluster was observed when literary metaphors were presented in the original contexts, with familiarity no longer correlating with meaningfulness. Context manipulation influenced familiarity, concreteness and difficulty ratings, which were lower in context than out of context, while meaningfulness increased. Throughout the different dimensions, the literary context seems to promote a global interpretative activity that enhances the openendedness of the metaphor as a semantic structure constantly open to all possible interpretations intended by the author and driven by the text. This dataset will be useful for the design of future experimental studies both on literary metaphor and on the role of context in figurative meaning, combining ecological validity and aesthetic aspects of language. © 2014 Bambini et al.","","Adolescent; Adult; Comprehension; Female; Humans; Judgment; Language; Male; Metaphor; Psycholinguistics; Young Adult; adult; Article; automation; cluster analysis; context; controlled study; correlation analysis; data base; ecological validity; female; grammar; human; information processing; Italian (citizen); language; linguistics; literature; male; probability; reading; university student; adolescent; comprehension; decision making; language; young adult","Tosey P., Sullivan W., Meyer M., Clean Sources: Six Metaphors A Minute?, (2013); Lakoff G., Johnson M., Metaphors We Live By.

However, most of the studies consider major standard languages, such as English, Dutch, Spanish or Italian. This is a limitation, since these languages display relatively simple systems that are fairly stable and do not allow to address language variation and change. Here we investigated gender agreement in a dialect of Southern Italy spoken in Agnone, using Event-Related Potentials. Compared with Italian and most standard Romance languages, the Agnonese gender system is more complex (with three target genders: feminine, masculine, neuter) and, also under the pressure of standard Italian, undergoing change, with the neuter merging into the masculine. Results showed that all determiner-noun gender mismatches elicited robust P600 and moderate Left Anterior Negativity (LAN) effects. Yet not all violations involving neuter nouns were equally outright. For masculine-neuter, the amplitude of the P600 was less pronounced than for feminine-neuter violations. Moreover, when looking at individual differences, the P600 for masculine-neuter was progressively reduced as participants’ competence in the Agnonese conservative variety decreased. Since sociolinguistics shows that individual variation within the speech community may reflect linguistic change, the smaller P600 exhibited by less conservative speakers could be described as a brain signature of ongoing language change in the Agnonese gender system. In other words, the attenuation of ungrammaticality-driven brain responses may provide a measurable indicator of the fading of the neuter and its merging into the masculine. This work paves the way to the neurolinguistic description of non-standard varieties and also breaks ground for a “diachronic neurolinguistics”, extending investigation into the neurobiology of language beyond the synchronic dimension. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agreement; Diachronic neurolinguistics; ERP; Language change; Romance dialects","adult; article; controlled study; electroencephalogram; event related potential; female; gender; human; human experiment; Italy; language; male; neurobiology; speech","Baayen R.H., Milin P., Analyzing reaction times, International Journal of Psychological Research, 3, 2, pp. 12-28, (2010); Bambini V., Bertini C., Schaeken W., Stella A., Di Russo F., Disentangling metaphor from context: An ERP study, Frontiers in Psychology, 7, (2016); Bambini V., Canal P., Neurolinguistic research on the Romance languages, The Oxford encyclopedia of romance linguistics, pp. 1-24, (2021); Bambini V., Trevisan M., EsploraCoLFIS: Un'interfaccia Web per ricerche sul Corpus e Lessico di Frequenza dell'Italiano Scritto, Quaderni Del Laboratorio Di Linguistica Della Scuola Normale Superiore, 11, pp. 1-16, (2012); Barber H., Carreiras M., Grammatical gender and number agreement in Spanish: An ERP comparison, Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 17, 1, pp. 137-153, (2005); Barr D.J., Levy R., Scheepers C., Tily H.J., Random effects structure for confirmatory hypothesis testing: Keep it maximal, Journal of Memory and Language, 68, 3, pp. 255-278, (2013); Bates D., Machler M., Bolker B., Walker S., Fitting linear mixed-effects models using lme4, Journal of Statistical Software, 67, 1, pp. 1-48, (2015); Bice K., Kroll J.F., Grammatical processing in two languages: How individual differences in language experience and cognitive abilities shape comprehension in heritage bilinguals, Journal of Neurolinguistics, 58, (2021); Bickel B., Witzlack-Makarevich A., Choudhary K.K., Schlesewsky M., Bornkessel-Schlesewsky I., The neurophysiology of language processing shapes the evolution of grammar: Evidence from case marking, PloS One, 10, 8, (2015); Bisang W., Luming W., Bornkessel-Schlesewsky I., Subjecthood in Chinese.

This study aims at establishing the role of communicative-pragmatic abilities in functioning, defined as a set of daily activities, in schizophrenia. This would contribute to enrich current models of the neurocognitive predictors of functioning, which have so far neglected pragmatics. Method: One hundred people with schizophrenia underwent a comprehensive assessment including functioning, cognition, theory of mind (ToM), and pragmatics. We tested the effects of cognition as a predictor of functioning, first mediated by ToM, then sequentially mediated by ToM and pragmatics. Next, we explored the predictive effect of cognition, sequentially mediated by ToM and pragmatics, on different functional domains (i.e., interpersonal relations, instrumental role, and personal autonomy). Results: The first model confirmed that ToM acts as a mediator between cognition and functioning. Importantly, the second model highlighted also the main mediating role of pragmatics. The mediation models on different functional domains showed that, when considered together, both pragmatics and ToM significantly influenced all aspects of functioning. When considered separately, pragmatics was significantly related to interpersonal functioning, while ToM to personal autonomy. Conclusions: Innovatively, our findings highlight that pragmatics has a main role, both direct and indirect, in affecting functioning. Of particular interest is that the impact of pragmatics encompasses different functional domains, and especially interpersonal functioning. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) <strong xmlns:lang=""en"">Key Points—Question: Does pragmatics, defined as the ability to interpret language in the context of use, have a role in the complex interplay of daily functioning and neuropsychological aspects in schizophrenia? Findings: Our findings innovatively show the significant effect of communicative-pragmatic abilities on daily functioning. Importance: These findings are relevant because: (a) they extend the theoretical models of functional disruption in schizophrenia; (b) they offer noteworthy knowledge for the development of rehabilitative interventions aiming at functional recovery. Next Steps: Future research should focus on the implementation of rehabilitative interventions targeting communicative-pragmatic abilities.

Less attention has been paid to social communication abilities, despite their presumptive affect on quality of life. We run the first comprehensive assessment of pragmatic skills in multiple sclerosis, evaluating also the relationship between pragmatics and other cognitive domains. Methods Forty-two multiple sclerosis patients and 42 controls were tested for pragmatic abilities, neuro-cognition, social cognition, depression, and fatigue. Results Patients performed poorly in most pragmatic tasks compared to controls. Globally, 55% of patients performed below the 5th percentile in the total pragmatic score. Notably, pragmatic skills did not differ between cognitively impaired and unimpaired patients. However, an association was found between pragmatics and verbal fluency, as measured in the Word List Generation. Finally, we observed an association of pragmatic abilities with social cognition, and a trend with psychosocial functioning. Conclusion Overall, the study shows a diffuse pragmatic impairment in multiple sclerosis, not associated with the patient's global neuropsychological profile. By contrast, our findings suggest a close relation between pragmatics and specific cognitive aspects such as executive functions, and between pragmatics and social cognition. This study underlines the need of looking beyond classical cognitive performance, to consider underestimated communicative disturbances of high clinical relevance. © 2017 Published by Oxford University Press.","Language and language disorder;

We present the case of a patient with active secondary progressive MS who, after a first neuropsychological assessment that evidenced only a slight pragmatic impairment, suffered a sudden worsening of her clinical conditions, treated with corticosteroids. After this clinical worsening, her pragmatic abilities declined markedly, both in comprehension and production. This worsening was accompanied by a decline only in one attention task, in the context of an overall stable cognitive functioning. We conclude that pragmatics may be a domain particularly susceptible to cognitive worsening, highlighting the importance of its assessment in clinical practice.

Yet we know very little about the role of ToM in real-time processing of metaphors in neurotypical adults. Here, we tested the relationship between ToM and metaphor through Event Related Potentials (ERPs) by capitalizing on the difference between metaphors inviting inferences on physical (Boxers are pandas) vs. mental aspects (Teachers are books). Physical metaphors involved a larger and sustained negativity compared to mental ones. This pattern resembled concreteness effects and suggests that physical metaphors may benefit from both verbal and perceptual information. Moreover, higher scores in the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), but not in the Animation task, were associated with a reduction of the N400 amplitude for both physical and mental metaphors. When exploring the ERP temporal trajectory with Generalized Additive Mixed Modeling, earlier differences between metaphors characterized individuals with higher RMET scores. Among the various ToM components, thus, emotion recognition seems to be involved in the processing of metaphors in general, with an earlier impact on the mental type. These findings highlight the multifaceted nature of metaphor, at the crossroad of language, social and perceptual experience. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","ERP; Experimental Pragmatics; Metaphor; Neuropragmatics; Reading the Mind in the Eyes; Theory of Mind","Adult; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials; Female; Humans; Language; Male; Metaphor; Theory of Mind; adult; article; boxer; controlled study; emotion; event related potential; female; human; human experiment; language; literature; male; role theory; teacher; theory of mind; electroencephalography; evoked response","Abell F., Happe F., Frith U., Do triangles play tricks?

One domain of particular interest is pragmatics, which refers to the capacity of using language in context for a successful communication. Several studies showed that some specific aspects of pragmatics - both in production and in comprehension - might be impaired in patients with PD. However, a clear picture of pragmatic abilities in PD is still missing, as most of the existing studies focused on specific aspects of the pragmatic competence rather than on sketching a complete pragmatic profile. Moreover, little is known on the potential role of protective factors in compensating the decline of communicative skills as the disease progresses. The present study has two aims: (1) to provide a complete picture of pragmatic abilities in patients with PD, by using a comprehensive battery (Assessment of Pragmatic Abilities and Cognitive Substrates, APACS) and by investigating the relationship with other aspects of cognitive functioning (e.g., working memory and Theory of Mind) and (2) to investigate whether Cognitive Reserve, i.e., the resilience to cognitive impairment provided by life experiences and activities, may compensate for the progressive pragmatic deficits in PD. We found that patients with PD, compared to healthy matched controls, had worse performance in discourse production and in the description of scenes, and that these impairments were tightly correlated with the severity of motor impairment, suggesting reduced intentionality of engaging in a communicative exchange. Patients with PD showed also an impairment in comprehending texts and humor, suggesting a problem in inferring from stories, which was related to general cognitive impairment. Notably, we did not find any significant difference between patients and controls in figurative language comprehension, a domain that is commonly impaired in other neurodegenerative diseases. This might be indicative of a specific profile of pragmatic impairment in patients with PD, worth of further investigation. Finally, Cognitive Reserve measures showed a high degree of association with pragmatic comprehension abilities, suggesting that the modification of life-styles could be a good candidate for compensating the possible problems in understanding the pragmatic aspects of language experienced by patients with PD. © 2019 Montemurro, Mondini, Signorini, Marchetto, Bambini and Arcara.","Cognitive Reserve; Communication; Discourse; Figurative language; Parkinson's disease; Pragmatic abilities","","Agrell B., Dehlin O., Nilsson I.L., Receptive aphasia in elderly stroke patients as assessed by the token test, Logoped.

However, little is known about the emotional response to tragedy-triggered humor, let alone Covid-19 humor. With a large-scale survey completed during the early stages of Italy's lockdown, we studied the appreciation (funniness and aversiveness) of different formats of Covid-19 humor shared on social media. Results of an analysis of the role of demographic, personality, and psychological distance factors with linear mixed models showed that Covid-19 humor lacks a “signature” of funniness, but displays a mark of aversiveness. Among demographics, age and gender were key factors: with increasing age and in women, Covid-19 humor was judged as more aversive. Individuals using humor to cope with uneasy circumstances judged Covid-19 humor as funnier and less aversive. Furthermore, the perceived risk of infection amplified Covid-19 humor aversiveness, while kilometrical distance from the first Italian contagion hotspot raised the amusement in global terms. These findings expand our knowledge about dark humor and should raise awareness of the great variation in the emotional impact of Covid-19 humor and of the need to ponder where and with whom to share the laugh about the pandemic. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Coping; Covid-19 humor; Dark humor; Humor appreciation; Internet humor; Psychological distance","","Aillaud M., Piolat A., Influence of gender on judgment of dark and nondark humor, Individ.

Recently, other pragmatic uses of words have been accounted for in the Relevance Theory framework, such as approximation, described in terms of conceptual adjustment that varies in degree and direction with respect to the case of metaphor. Despite the theoretical distinctions, there is very poor experimental evidence addressing the metaphor/metonymy distinction, and none concerning approximation. Here we used meticulously built materials to investigate the interpretation mechanisms of these three phenomena through timed sensicality judgments. Results revealed that interpreting metaphors and approximations differs from literal interpretation both in accuracy and reaction times, with higher difficulty and costs for metaphors than for approximations. This suggests similar albeit gradual interpretative costs, in line with the latest account of Relevance Theory. Metonymy, on the contrary, almost equates literal comprehension and calls for a theoretical distinction from metaphor. Overall, this work represents a first attempt to provide an empirical basis for a theory-sound and psychologically-grounded taxonomy of figurative and loose uses of language. © 2013 Bambini, Ghio, Moro and Schumacher.","Experimental pragmatics; Figurative language; Loose use; Metaphor; Pragmatics; Sensicality judgments","","Annaz D., Van Herwegen J., Thomas M., Fishman R., Karmiloff-Smith A., Rundblad G., Comprehension of metaphor and metonymy in children with Williams syndrome, Int.

Yet pragmatics is rarely included in clinical settings. This paper aims to promote a clinical consideration of pragmatics as a target of assessment and intervention. We investigated the frequency of the pragmatic deficit, its cognitive substrates, and the relation with quality of life. Methods Pragmatic abilities were compared in a sample of patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls based on a comprehensive pragmatic test (APACS). We assessed also for psychopathology, cognition, social cognition, and quality of life. We explored the co-occurrence of deficits in different domains, and we used multiple regressions to investigate the effect of cognition and social cognition on pragmatics, and of pragmatics on quality of life. Results Pragmatic abilities, especially comprehending discourse and non-literal meanings, were compromised in schizophrenia, with 77% of patients falling below cutoff. Pragmatic deficit co-occurred with cognitive or socio-cognitive deficits in approximately 30% of cases. Multiple regression analysis confirmed the interplay of cognition and social cognition in pragmatic behavior. Quality of life was predicted by symptoms and by pragmatic abilities. Conclusions The high frequency of impairment suggests that the pragmatic deficit is a core feature of schizophrenia, associated with quality of life. Cognitive and socio-cognitive abilities might represent necessary though not sufficient building blocks for the acquisition of pragmatic abilities throughout development. Therefore, a more precise incorporation of pragmatics in the description of the pathology is of high clinical and translational relevance. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","","Adult; Case-Control Studies; Cognition; Communication Disorders; Comprehension; Female; Humans; Male; Quality of Life; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenic Psychology; Social Behavior; adult; aged; Article; clinical article; cognition; comparative study; comprehension; controlled study; disease association; disease severity; DSM-IV; female; human; intelligence quotient; male; mental patient; outcome assessment; Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; quality of life; schizophrenia; social cognition; social interaction; test retest reliability; token test; Wechsler adult intelligence scale; case control study; communication disorder; complication; comprehension; psychology; schizophrenia; social behavior","Bleuler E., Dementia praecox: on the group of schizophrenias (J.Zimkin, trans.), (1950); Andreasen N.C., Thought, language, and communication disorders, Arch Gen Psychiatry, 36, (1979); Covington M.A., He C., Brown C., Naci L., McClain J.T., Fjordbak B.S., Et al., Schizophrenia and the structure of language: the linguist's view, Schizophr Res, 77, pp. 85-98, (2005); DeLisi L.E., Speech disorder in schizophrenia: review of the literature and exploration of its relation to the uniquely human capacity for language, Schizophr Bull, 27, pp. 481-496, (2001); Kuperberg G.R., Language in schizophrenia part 1: an introduction, Lang Linguist Compass, 4, pp. 576-589, (2010); Moro A., Bambini V., Bosia M., Anselmetti S., Riccaboni R., Cappa S.F., Et al., Detecting syntactic and semantic anomalies in schizophrenia, Neuropsychologia, 79, pp. 147-157, (2015); Barrera A., McKenna P.J., Berrios G.E., Formal thought disorder in schizophrenia: an executive or a semantic deficit?, Psychol Med, 35, pp. 121-132, (2005); Cummings L., Pragmatic disorders, (2014); Sperber D., Wilson D., Pragmatics, Oxford Handb.

We distinguished between two types of metaphors and created a Physical and Mental Metaphors task, echoing a similar distinction for ToM. Nine-year-olds scored lower than older age-groups in ToM as well as in the interpretation of mental, but not physical, metaphors. Moreover, nine-year-olds (but not older children) who are better in ToM are also better in interpreting mental, but not physical, metaphors. This suggests that the link between metaphor and ToM is stronger when metaphorical interpretation involves mental aspects, and it is more evident in early rather than later childhood.

Yet, it is unclear what role mindreading plays in developing metaphor skills. Here we examined the relationship between metaphor and Theory of Mind (ToM) in middle childhood by using two different tasks. In addition to the Physical and Mental Metaphors task (PMM), based on the verbal explanation of physical and mental metaphors, we revived the Referential Metaphors task for children (Noveck, Bianco, & Castry, 2001), where metaphorical and literal referents are presented in a narrative context. The sample included 169 8-, 9-, and 10-year-old children, assessed also for ToM (via the Strange Stories) and other linguistic and cognitive skills as control variables. In the PMM, ToM supported the understanding of mental (but not physical) metaphors in 9-year-olds only, whereas in the Referential Metaphors task ToM supported accuracy of understanding metaphors (but not literal items) in younger children as well. At age 10, ToM effects were negligible in both tasks. These findings suggest that ToM has a task-specific role in metaphor, linked to the characteristics of the items in the task at stake, being for instance greater for metaphors with mental (compared to physical) content and for non-literal (compared to literal) referents. The findings also suggest that the relationship between ToM and metaphor skills is developmental sensitive, as children start to capitalize on ToM earlier in development when the metaphor context is richer, and these effects fade with age. Theoretically, these data argue in favor of the relevance-theoretic account of metaphor, spelling out different ways in which ToM might support metaphor resolution across tasks, for instance by providing better access to the psychological lexicon (i.e., terms referring to mental states) and better context processing, serving as a springboard to achieve sophisticated pragmatic skills in middle childhood. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Experimental pragmatics; Metaphor; Metaphor comprehension; Pragmatic development; Pragmatics; Theory of Mind","Child; Comprehension; Humans; Language; Language Tests; Linguistics; Metaphor; Theory of Mind; article; child; childhood; clinical assessment; comprehension; controlled study; female; human; human experiment; literature; male; mental health; narrative; skill; spelling; theoretical study; theory of mind; comprehension; language; language test; linguistics; literature","Agostoni G., Bischetti L., Bechi M., Buonocore M., Cavallaro R., Lecce S., Bosia M., Physical and mental metaphor interpretation: Relationship with theory of mind in patients affected by schizophrenia [poster presentation], Book of abstracts - XPRAG.it 2019, (2019); Almor A., Arunachalam S., Strickland B., When the creampuff beat the boxer: Working memory, cost, and function in reading metaphoric reference, Metaphor and Symbol, 22, 2, pp. 169-193, (2007); Arcara G., Tonini E., Muriago G., Mondin E., Sgarabottolo E., Bertagnoni G., Bambini V., Pragmatics and figurative language in individuals with traumatic brain injury: Fine-grained assessment and relevance-theoretic considerations, Aphasiology, 34, 8, pp. 1070-1100, (2020); Ash S., Nerlove H., The development of double function terms in children: An exploratory study, Perspectives in psychological theory, (1960); Bambini V., Arcara G., Bosinelli F., Buonocore M., Bechi M., Cavallaro R., Bosia M., A leopard cannot change its spots: A novel pragmatic account of concretism in schizophrenia, Neuropsychologia, 139, (2020); Bambini V., Bertini C., Schaeken W., Stella A., Di Russo F., Disentangling metaphor from context: An ERP study, Frontiers in Psychology, 7, (2016); Bambini V., Bott L., Schumacher P.B., It is not always a matter of time: Addressing the costs of metaphor and metonymy through a speed-accuracy trade-off study, Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology / Revue Canadienne de Psychologie Expérimentale, 75, 2, pp. 189-196, (2021); Baron-Cohen S., Wheelwright S., Hill J., Raste Y., Plumb I., The “Reading the mind in the eyes” test revised version: A study with normal adults, and adults with Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism, Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 42, 2, pp. 241-251, (2001); Bates D., Machler M., Bolker B., Walker S., lme4: Linear mixed-effects models using Eigen and S4.

In this study we addressed the role of executive skills, including inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility, in older adults’ communicative-pragmatic abilities. Pragmatics was extensively assessed by measuring the understanding of figurative language, narrative texts, humor, and implicatures. A hierarchical regression analysis using composite scores evidenced a global effect of executive functions on communicative-pragmatic abilities, beyond demographic and theory of mind aspects. More fine-grained analyses showed that working memory was the strongest predictor of all pragmatic tasks. Specifically, comprehending narratives and humor seemed to capitalize primarily upon working memory, whereas figurative language and implicatures relied on working memory and to some extent cognitive flexibility. Conversely, inhibition did not stand out as a robust predictor of pragmatics. We argue that working memory allows for the simultaneous consideration of multiple pieces of information needed for pragmatic inferencing, and that only once working memory has played its role other executive aspects, such as cognitive flexibility and inhibition, might come into play. Overall, this study highlights the diverse role of executive skills in pragmatics in aging, and more generally contributes to shed light on pragmatic competence in older adults. © 2021, Marta Olivetti Belardinelli and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Aging;

Yet most of these studies test metaphor in isolation while in natural conversation metaphors do not come out of the blue but embedded in linguistic and extra-linguistic context. This study aimed at assessing the role of context in the metaphor comprehension process. We recorded EEG activity while participants were presented with metaphors and equivalent literal expressions in a minimal context (Experiment 1) and in a supportive context where the word expressing the ground between the metaphor's topic and vehicle was made explicit (Experiment 2). The N400 effect was visible only in minimal context, whereas the P600 was visible both in the absence and in the presence of contextual cues. These findings suggest that the N400 observed for metaphor is related to contextual aspects, possibly indexing contextual expectations on upcoming words that guide lexical access and retrieval, while the P600 seems to reflect truly pragmatic interpretative processes needed to make sense of a metaphor and derive the speaker's meaning, also in the presence of contextual cues. In sum, previous information in the linguistic context biases toward a metaphorical interpretation but does not suppress interpretative pragmatic mechanisms to establish the intended meaning. © 2016 Bambini, Bertini, Schaeken, Stella and Di Russo.","Context; Experimental pragmatics; Metaphor; N400; Neuropragmatics; P600; Pragmatics","","Arzouan Y., Goldstein A., Faust M., Brainwaves are stethoscopes: ERP correlates of novel metaphor comprehension, Brain Res, 60, pp. 69-81, (2007); Arzouan Y., Goldstein A., Faust M., Dynamics of hemispheric activity during metaphor comprehension: electrophysiological measures, Neuroimage, 36, pp. 222-231, (2007); Bambini V., Neuropragmatics: A foreword, Ital.

APACS focuses on two main domains, namely discourse and non-literal language, combining traditional tasks with refined linguistic materials in Italian, in a unified framework inspired by language pragmatics. The test includes six tasks (Interview, Description, Narratives, Figurative Language 1, Humor, Figurative Language 2) and three composite scores (Pragmatic Productions, Pragmatic Comprehension, APACS Total). Psychometric properties and normative data were computed on a sample of 119 healthy participants representative of the general population. The analysis revealed acceptable internal consistency and good test-retest reliability for almost every APACS task, suggesting that items are coherent and performance is consistent over time. Factor analysis supports the validity of the test, revealing two factors possibly related to different facets and substrates of the pragmatic competence. Finally, excellent match between APACS items and scores and the pragmatic constructs measured in the test was evidenced by experts' evaluation of content validity. The performance on APACS showed a general effect of demographic variables, with a negative effect of age and a positive effect of education. The norms were calculated by means of state-of-the-art regression methods. Overall, APACS is a valuable tool for the assessment of pragmatic deficits in verbal communication. The short duration and easiness of administration make the test especially suitable to use in clinical settings. In presenting APACS, we also aim at promoting the inclusion of pragmatics in the assessment practice, as a relevant dimension in defining the patient's cognitive profile, given its vital role for communication and social interaction in daily life. The combined use of APACS with other neuropsychological tests could also improve our understanding of the cognitive substrates of pragmatic abilities and their breakdown.","Discourse; Figurative language; Neuropragmatics; Neuropsychological assessment; Pragmatics","","Amanzio M., Geminiani G., Leotta D., Cappa S., Metaphor comprehension in Alzheimer's disease: novelty matters, Brain Lang, 107, pp. 1-10, (2008); Angeleri R., Bosco F.M., Gabbatore I., Bara B.G., Sacco K., Assessment battery for communication (ABaCo): normative data, Behav.

However, the cognitive architecture that underlies humor impairment in this population remains unclear, with humorous items sometimes assessed in the context of the communicative-pragmatic profiling and sometimes included in Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks. Here we enrolled 116 people with schizophrenia and 116 healthy controls, who were administered a task including jokes based on sound aspects and jokes based on mental aspects (Phonological and Mental Jokes task). Both comprehension accuracy (ability to select the funny ending of the joke) and appreciation (ratings of funniness) were evaluated, together with other linguistic, cognitive, and clinical measures. Results highlighted a diffuse impairment in humor comprehension in schizophrenia compared to controls, with mental jokes being more difficult for both groups. Humor comprehension was robustly associated with the patients’ global pragmatic and linguistic profile, while the association with ToM was negligible. Another remarkable finding was the increased appreciation of humor in individuals with schizophrenia, who rated jokes (both correctly and incorrectly completed) as funnier than controls did. Funniness ratings were not predicted by any measure, pointing to a dimension untied from cognition or psychopathology. Overall, this study offers evidence – on a considerably large sample – of altered humor understanding and appreciation in schizophrenia, sketching a cognitive architecture where humor impairment stands together with communicative impairment, rather than with social cognition. This has implications not only for the assessment of humor but also for how to treat it in patients to improve their ability to navigate the social world. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Clinical pragmatics; Humor; Jokes; Neuropragmatics; Pragmatics; Schizophrenia","accuracy; adult; age; Article; association; cognition; comparative study; comprehension; controlled study; demographics; disorientation; female; grammar; human; humor; language ability; major clinical study; male; mental disease; network analysis; schizophrenia; skill; verbal humor","Berger P., Bitsch F., Falkenberg I., Humor in psychiatry: lessons from neuroscience, psychopathology, and treatment research, Front.

A comprehensive pragmatic assessment tool was employed, targeting production and comprehension (Assessment of Pragmatic Abilities and Cognitive Substrates [APACS]). Participants were also administered a series of standardized tests to assess verbal and non-verbal cognitive abilities, including executive functions and social cognition tests. Data were analysed with the aim of understanding whether pragmatic abilities are compromised in dyslexia and of exploring associations between pragmatic performance and other cognitive domains. The performance of the dyslexia group was poorer than that of the control group in both expressive and receptive modalities. Data showed diffuse problems across several domains, with the greatest challenge posed by inferring nonliteral meanings, which indicates that pragmatic inefficiency is an important aspect of the linguistic and communicative profile of dyslexia in adulthood. Explorative correlations highlighted a relation between pragmatic performance and reading and vocabulary abilities, as well as between pragmatics and working memory. This suggests that pragmatic difficulties are strongly tied to the most distinctive aspects of dyslexia, namely, phonological awareness, verbal short-term memory, pseudo-word repetition, whereas the link with high-level executive functions and Theory of Mind is negligible. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","figurative language;

Although models that argue for longer processing times for figurative compared to literal meanings have been largely criticized, figurative language is often associated with increased cognitive work. We investigated whether such greater cognitive work is indicative of more time-consuming processes or rather lower availability of figurative meanings, and whether there are differences between figurative types. We used a multi-response Speed-Accuracy Trade-off paradigm, where a meaningfulness judgment task was combined with a response deadline procedure to estimate speed and accuracy independently for metaphorical (Those dancers are butterflies) and metonymic sentences (That student reads Camilleri), compared with literal equivalents. While both metaphors and metonymies showed lower asymptote, that is, they were judged less accurately than literal counterparts, only metonymies were associated with a processing delay. Moreover, the difference in asymptote with respect to the literal condition was greater for metaphor than for metonymy. These findings indicate that the process that derives metaphor and metonymy is more complex than the process that derives literal meanings, even more so for metaphor. The processing delay, however, is present only in the case of metonymies. Taken together, our study offers key findings that reconcile a lively debate on the time course of figurative language comprehension, showing that the cost of non-literal meaning is not always a matter of time, and depends also on the figurative type.

Yet, a consensus on a standardized protocol for intraoperative language mapping is still lacking. More specifically, very limited information is offered about intraoperative assessment of a crucial component of language such as syntax. This review aims at critically analyzing the intraoperative studies investigating the cerebral basis of syntactic processing. A comprehensive query was performed on the literature, returning a total of 18 studies. These papers were analyzed according to two complementary criteria, based on the distinction between morphosyntax and syntax. The first criterion focused on the tasks and stimuli employed intraoperatively. Studies were divided into three different groups: group 1 included those studies that overtly aimed at investigating morphosyntactic processes; group 2 included studies that did not explicitly focus on syntax, yet employed stimuli requiring morphosyntactic processing; and group 3 included studies reporting some generic form of syntactic deficit, although not further investigated. The second criterion focused on the syntactic structures of the sentences assessed intraoperatively, analyzing the canonicity of sentence structure (i.e., canonical versus non-canonical word order). The global picture emerging from our analysis indicates that what was investigated in the intraoperative literature is morphosyntactic processing, rather than pure syntax. The study of the neurobiology of syntax during awake surgery seems thus to be still at an early stage, in need of systematic, linguistically grounded investigations. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Italia.","Awake brain surgery;

These theories are mostly based on empirical evidence obtained in experimental settings that could induce artificial effects normally not occurring in natural processing. In this study we investigated the processing of compounds as compared to noncompound complex words in Italian through a reading task with eye movement recording. We included both head-initial and head-final compounds, in order to test whether the position of the head may influence the reading process. After ruling out the effects of length and frequency, we observed that pseudocompounds (i.e., words with a segment homograph to a real word in the leftmost part) elicited longer total reading times than all other types of complex words, including compounds. Furthermore, head-final compounds elicited longer total reading times than head-initial compounds. The results suggest that a word structure resembling a compound may induce longer processing, presumably related to unexpected morphological structures. The results also converge with previous evidence that in some cases there is a higher processing costs for head-final as opposed to head-initial compounds, possibly indexing a reanalysis of the stimulus in order to correctly assign the constituent properties. However, a deeper analysis restricted to compounds revealed a more complex scenario where several variables interact with headedness (namely, first and second constituent frequency, compound frequency, and compound length), and future studies are needed to discriminate among possible interpretations. Overall, our findings suggest that longer reading times are related to solving incongruities due to noncanonical structures, rather than to morphologically complexity per se. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Compound headedness; Compound words; Eye movements; Morphological decomposition; Morphology","Adolescent; Eye Movements; Female; Humans; Italy; Language; Male; Psycholinguistics; Reading; Semantics; Vocabulary; Young Adult; Compound headedness; Compound words; Eye movements.; Morphological decomposition; Morphology; adolescent; article; Compound headedness; Compound words; eye movement; Eye movements.; female; human; Italy; language; linguistics; male; Morphological decomposition; morphology; reading; semantics; young adult","Amenta S., Crepaldi D., Morphological processing as we know it: An analytical review of morphological effects in visual word identification, Frontiers in Psychology, 3, pp. 1-12, (2012); Andrews S., Morphological influences on lexical access: Lexical or nonlexical effects?, Journal of Memory and Language, 25, pp. 726-740, (1986); Andrews S., Miller B., Rayner K., Eye movements and morphological segmentation of compound words: There is a mouse in mousetrap, European Journal of Cognitive Psychology, 16, pp. 285-311, (2004); Arcara G., Marelli M., Buodo G., Mondini S., Compound headedness in the mental lexicon: An event-related potential study, Cognitive Neuropsychology, pp. 1-20, (2013); Baayen R.H., languageR: Data sets and functions with, Analyzing Linguistic Data: A practical introduction to statistics, (2011); Baayen R.H., Davidson D.J., Bates D.M., Mixed-effects modeling with crossed random effects for subjects and items, Journal of Memory & Language, 59, pp. 390-412, (2008); Baayen R.H., Milin P., Durdevic D.F., Hendrix P., Marelli M., An amorphous model for morphological processing in visual comprehension based on naive discriminative learning, Psychological Review, 118, pp. 438-481, (2011); Baayen R.H., Wurm L.H., Aycock J., Lexical dynamics for low-frequency complex words: A regression study across tasks and modalities, The Mental Lexicon, 2, pp. 419-463, (2007); Bambini V., EsploraColLFIS, (2012); Bambini V., Trevisan M., EsploraCoLFIS: Un'interfaccia web per le ricerche sul Corpus e Lessico di Frequenza dell'Italiano Scritto (CoLFIS, Quaderni del Laboratorio di Linguistica, 11, pp. 1-16, (2012); Baroni M., Bernardini S., Comastri F., Piccioni L., Volpi A., Aston G., Mazzoleni M., La repubblica corpus, (2004); Baroni M., Bernardini S., Comastri F., Piccioni L., Volpi A., Aston G., Mazzoleni M., Introducing the la Repubblica corpus.

ERPs were time-locked to an auditorily presented word that was preceded by a repeated, related or unrelated pattern masked prime. We registered a two-way N400-difference between unrelated and related/repeated primes, followed by a late positive component (LPC) for repetition priming. Related primes appear to facilitate the lexical-semantic processing of the target to the same extent repeated primes do (equally attenuated N400). Repetition priming exerts additional demands (LPC), possibly related to enhanced recollection or to the construction of a discourse representation. This evidences that the sentential context interacts with masked priming in two vital ways, differing from word list contexts, and paves the way for future studies on the mechanisms of lexical/semantic processes beyond the word level. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","ERPs; LPC; Masked priming; N400; Sentence context","Auditory Cortex; Evoked Potentials, Auditory; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Pattern Recognition, Physiological; Perceptual Masking; Semantics; Young Adult; adult; article; attenuation; auditory masking; auditory threshold; brain electrophysiology; evoked auditory response; female; hearing; hearing test; human; human experiment; language; late positive component; male; normal human; priority journal; repetition priming; semantic memory; sentence context; speech; task performance; word recognition","Burkhardt P., Inferential bridging relations reveal distinct neural mechanisms: evidence from event-related brain potentials, Brain and Language, 98, pp. 159-168, (2006); Grainger J., Diependaele K., Spinelli E., Ferrand L., Farioli F., Masked repetition and phonological priming within and across modalities, Journal of Experimental Psychology Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 29, pp. 1256-1269, (2003); Grainger J., Holcomb P.J., Watching the word go by: on the time-course of component processes in visual word recognition, Language and Linguistics Compass, 3, pp. 128-156, (2009); Grossi G., Relatedness proportion effects on masked associative priming: an ERP study, Psychophysiology, 43, pp. 21-30, (2006); Holcomb P.J., Anderson J.E., Cross-modal semantic priming - a time-course analysis using event-related brain potentials, Language & Cognitive Processes, 8, pp. 379-411, (1993); Holcomb P.J., Grainger J., On the time course of visual word recognition: an event-related potential investigation using masked repetition priming, Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 18, pp. 1631-1643, (2006); Holcomb P.J., Grainger J., Exploring the temporal dynamics of visual word recognition in the masked repetition priming paradigm using event-related potentials, Brain Research, 1180, pp. 39-58, (2007); Holcomb P.J., Grainger J., ERP effects of short interval masked associative and repetition priming, Journal of Neurolinguistics, 22, pp. 301-312, (2009); Holcomb P.J., Reder L., Misra M., Grainger J., The effects of prime visibility on ERP measures of masked priming, Cognitive Brain Research, 24, pp. 155-172, (2005); Keppel G., Design and Analysis: A Researchers Handbook, (1991); Kiefer M., The N400 is modulated by unconsciously perceived masked words: further evidence for an automatic spreading activation account of N400 priming effects, Cognitive Brain Research, 13, pp. 27-39, (2002); Kiefer M., Spitzer M., Time course of conscious and unconscious semantic brain activation, Neuroreport, 11, pp. 2401-2407, (2000); Kiyonaga K., Grainger J., Midgley K., Holcomb P.J., Masked cross-modal repetition priming: an event-related potential investigation, Language & Cognitive Processes, 22, pp. 337-376, (2007); Misra M., Holcomb P.J., Event-related potential indices of masked repetition priming, Psychophysiology, 40, pp. 115-130, (2003); O'Rourke T.B., Holcomb P.J., Electrophysiological evidence for the efficiency of spoken word processing, Biological Psychology, 60, pp. 121-150, (2002); Paller K.A., Kutas M., McIsaac H.K., Monitoring conscious recollection via the electrical-activity of the brain, Psychological Science, 6, pp. 107-111, (1995); Rolke B., Heil M., Streb J., Hennighausen E., Missed prime words within the attentional blink evoke an N400 semantic priming effect, Psychophysiology, 38, pp. 165-174, (2001); Rugg M.D., The effects of semantic priming and word repetition on event-related potentials, Psychophysiology, 22, pp. 642-647, (1985); Rugg M.D., Dissociation of semantic priming, word and non-word repetition effects by event-related potentials, The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology Section A: Human Experimental Psychology, 39, pp. 123-148, (1987); Rugg M.D., Nagy M.E., Event-related potentials and recognition memory for words, Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology, 72, pp. 395-406, (1989); Schumacher P.B., Baumann S., Pitch accent type affects the N400 during referential processing, Neuroreport, 21, pp. 618-622, (2010); Swinney D.A., Onifer W., Prather P., Hirshkowitz M., Semantic facilitation across sensory modalities in the processing of individual words and sentences, Memory and Cognition, 7, pp. 159-165, (1979); van Petten C., Coulson S., Rubin S., Plante E., Parks M., Time course of word identification and semantic integration in spoken language, Journal of Experimental Psychology Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 25, pp. 394-417, (1999); van Petten C., Kutas M., Kluender R., Mitchiner M., McIsaac H.K., Fractionating the word repetition effect with event-related brain potentials, Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 3, pp. 131-150, (1991)","2-s2.0-84868510511"

However, there is a large variation in the results across studies, possibly related to the properties of the metaphor tasks. This preregistered systematic review and meta-analysis (a) explored the properties of the metaphor tasks used in ASD research, and (b) investigated the group difference between individuals with ASD and TD on metaphor comprehension, as well as the relationship between the task properties and any between-study variation. A systematic search was undertaken in seven relevant databases. Fourteen studies fulfilled our predetermined inclusion criteria. Across tasks, we detected four types of response format and a great variety of metaphors in terms of familiarity, syntactic structure, and linguistic context. Individuals with TD outperformed individuals with ASD on metaphor comprehension (Hedges' g =-0.63). Verbal explanation response format was utilized in the study showing the largest effect size in the group comparison. However, due to the sparse experimental manipulations, the role of task properties could not be established. Future studies should consider and report task properties to determine their role in metaphor comprehension, and to inform experimental paradigms as well as educational assessment. © 2019 Cambridge University Press.","autism spectrum disorder; experimental pragmatics; figurative language; response format","","Adachi T., Koeda T., Hirabayashi S., Maeoka Y., Shiota M., Wright E.C., Wasa A., The metaphor and sarcasm scenario test: A new instrument to help differentiate high functioning pervasive developmental disorder from attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Brain & Development, 26, pp. 301-306, (2004); Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-IV, (1994); Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-IV-TR, (2000); Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-V, (2013); Arcara G., Tonini E., Muriago G., Mondin E., Sgarabottolo E., Bertagnoni G., Bambini V., Pragmatics and figurative language in individuals with traumatic brain injury: Fine-grained assessment and relevance-theoretic considerations, Aphasiology, (2019); Bambini V., Bertini C., Schaeken W., Stella A., Di Russo F., Disentangling metaphor from context: An ERP study, Frontiers in Psychology, 7, (2016); Bambini V., Gentili C., Ricciardi E., Bertinetto P.M., Pietrini P., Decomposing metaphor processing at the cognitive and neural level through functional magnetic resonance imaging, Brain Research Bulletin, 86, pp. 203-216, (2011); Bambini V., Ghio M., Moro A., Schumacher P.B., Differentiating among pragmatic uses of words through timed sensicality judgments, Frontiers in Psychology, 4, (2013); Bambini V., Resta D., Grimaldi M., A dataset of metaphors from the Italian literature: Exploring psycholinguistic variables and the role of context, PLOS ONE, 9, (2014); Bishop D.V.M., Norbury C.F., Executive functions in children with communication impairments, in relation to autistic symptomatology 2.

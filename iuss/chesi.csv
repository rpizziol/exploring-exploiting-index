In both experiments, we used the same materials presenting a manipulation on person features: second person plural pronouns and plural definite determiners alternate in introducing a full NP (“it was [DP1 the/you [NP bankers]]i that [DP2 the/you [NP lawyers]] have avoided _i at the party”) in a language, Italian, with overt person (and number) subject-verb agreement. As results, we first observed that the advantage of the bare pronominal forms reported in previous experiments (Gordon et al., 2001; Warren and Gibson, 2005, a.o.) is lost when the full NP (the “lexical restriction” in Belletti and Rizzi, 2013) is present. Second, an advantage for the mismatch condition, Art1-Pro2, in which the focalized subject is introduced by the determiner and the OC subject by the pronoun, as opposed to the matching Pro1-Pro2 condition, is observed, both off-line (higher acceptability and accuracy in answering comprehension questions after eyetracking) and on-line (e.g., smaller number of regressions from the subject region); third, we found a relevant difference between acceptability and accuracy in comprehension questions: despite similar numerical patterns in both off-line measures, the difference across conditions in accuracy is mostly not significant, while it is significant in acceptability. Moreover, while the matching condition Pro1-Pro2 is perceived as nearly ungrammatical (far below the mean acceptability across-conditions), the accuracy in comprehension is still high (close to 80%). To account for these facts, we compare different formal competence and processing models that predict difficulties in OC constructions: similarity-based (Gordon et al., 2001, a.o.), memory load (Gibson, 1998), and intervention-based (Friedmann et al., 2009) accounts are compared to processing oriented ACT-R-based predictions (Lewis and Vasishth, 2005) and to top-down Minimalist derivations (Chesi, 2015). We conclude that most of these approaches fail in making predictions able to reconcile the competence and the performance perspective in a coherent way to the exception of the top-down model that is able to predict correctly both the on-line and the off-line main effects obtained. © Copyright © 2019 Chesi and Canal.","complexity; cue-based retrieval; intervention; memory load; object cleft; pronominal determiners; similarity; top-down derivation","","Aho A.V., Ullman J.D., The theory of parsing, translation, and compiling, Parsing, 1, (1972); Anderson J.R., Human symbol manipulation within an integrated cognitive architecture, Cogn.

FREC is crucially based on the usage of memory predicted by the discussed parsing algorithm and it correctly fits with the reading time revealed.","","Computational linguistics; Linguistics; Feature retrieval; Nonlocal; Parsing algorithm; Phase based; Syntactics","Belletti A., Rizzi L., Intervention in Grammar and Processing.

In these pages, I propose that such distinction is unnecessary if we aim at explanatory adequacy (in the sense of Chomsky 1965, i.e. we want to capture not only what expressions are part of our language and which structure they have, but also why it is so): in fact, there are alternative ways of looking at standard «performance issues» that allow us to explain a relevant set of psycholinguistic data otherwise teased apart from the core linguistic empirical evidence. As in the mainstream linguistic frameworks, I will assume that any language (i.e. an infinite set of well-formed sentences) can be described as an intensional (mechanic) procedure that exhaustively predicts which sentence is part of the language (or can be generated by an explicit grammar for this language) and which expression is not (i.e. it cannot be generated by such a grammar). The proposed grammatical description (inspired by the recent Minimalist debate, Chomsky 1995; 2001), unlike other approaches (e.g. MacDonald et al. 1994, and standard minimalism itself), can predict asymmetries related to performance issues produced by center embedding and relative clauses processing (§2 and §3) by implementing structure building operations in derivational, directionally-constrained terms: the main intuition is that the recursive process of phrase formation should operate Top-Down and Left-Right (as discussed in Phillips 1996 and Chesi 2004, §4, contra standard proposals, e.g. Chomsky 1995; 2001). This seems to be not only explanatory adequate (§4.1), but also cognitively plausible from the point of view of other high cognitive systems like motor control (§5).","Competence; Explanatory adequacy; Minimalist grammar; Performance; Top-down processing","","Berwick R.C., Weinberg A.S., The grammatical basis of linguistic performance: Language use and acquisition, (1986); Boecks C., The Oxford handbook of linguistic minimalism, (2011); Bresnan J., A realistic transformational grammar, Linguistic theory and psychological reality, pp. 1-59, (1978); Chesi C., Phases and cartography in linguistic computation, (2004); Chesi C., Phases and complexity in phrase structure building, Computational Linguistics in the Netherlands 2004: Selected papers from the fifteenth CLIN meeting, (2005); Chesi C., An introduction to phase-based minimalist grammars: Why move is top-down and from left-to-right, StIL - Studies in Linguistics, 2, pp. 38-75, (2007); Chomsky N., Syntactic structures, (1957); Chomsky N., Conditions on transformations, A festschrift for Morris Halle, (1973); Chomsky N., Lectures on Government and Binding: The Pisa Lectures, (1981); Chomsky N., The minimalist program, (1995); Chomsky N., On phases, Foundational issues in linguistic theory, (2008); Elman J., Finding structure in time, Cognitive Science, 14, pp. 179-211, (1990); Frazier L., Fodor J.D., The sausage machine: A new two-stage parsing model, Cognition, 6, pp. 291-325, (1978); Friedmann N., Belletti A., Rizzi L., Relativized relatives: Types of intervention in the acquisition of A-bar dependencies, Lingua, 119, pp. 67-88, (2009); Gibson E., Linguistic complexity: Locality of syntactic dependencies, Cognition, 68, pp. 1-76, (1998); Gordon P.C., Hendrick R., Johnson M., Memory interference during language processing, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory and Cognition, 27, pp. 1411-1423, (2001); Hale J., What a rational parser would do, Cognitive Science, 35, pp. 399-443, (2011); Hauser M.D., Chomsky N., Fitch W., The faculty of language: What is it, who has it, and how did it evolve?, Science, 298, pp. 1569-1579, (2002); Jackendoff R., Foundations of language, (2002); Jackendoff R., A parallel architecture perspective on language and processing, Brain Research, 1146, pp. 2-22, (2007); Loeb G.E., Brown I.E., Cheng E.J., A hierarchical foundation for models of sensorimotor control, Experimental Brain Research, 126, pp. 1-18, (1999); MacDonald M.C., Pearlmutter N.J., Seidenberg M.S., Lexical nature of syntactic ambiguity resolution, Psychological Review, 101, pp. 676-703, (1994); Miall R.C., Wolpert D.M., Forward models for physiological motor control, Neural Networks, 9, pp. 1265-1279, (1996); Miller G.A., Chomsky N., Finitary models of language users, Handbook of mathematical psychology, 2, pp. 419-491, (1963); Phillips C., Order and structure, (1996); Rizzi L., Relativized minimality, (1990); Traxler M.J., Morris R.K., Seely R.E., Processing subject and object relative clauses: Evidence from eye movements, Journal of Memory & Language, 47, pp. 69-90, (2002)","2-s2.0-84872939381"

If we look at human languages, a total order is always established among discrete events, which are the distinct pronunciations of the words (and morphemes they are formed by) in a sentence. Notice that this is not a necessary condition: if we think of the total order as a restriction imposed by the spoken modality, we could image a sign language in which, for instance, two arguments (e.g. «Eva» and «the apple») of a certain predicate (e.g. «eats») could be co-articulated exactly at the same time in space, one with one hand and another with the other hand in a temporally and spatially symmetrical situation. To our knowledge this pos sibility is limited by several restrictions in any sign language around the world. So we assume that «time» is an essential ingredient of any human language and must be included in a theory that aims at being cognitively adequate. More precisely, our hypothesis is that «time» induces an asymmetric (total) relation among spelled-out linguistic units and this is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for the correct structural analysis of the sentence, hence for its correct interpretation. The other crucial property is hierarchy: implicit groups of words (phrase structures) that constraint temporal expectations and create complex (recursive) meaningful units. Our intent in this paper is to argue, by analyzing simple recurrent networks expectations and machine learning approaches to automatic classification on a very simple linguistic fact like anaphoric binding, that the first property (linear order) is neither a simple articulatory-perceptual restriction (also known as a «Phonetic Form effect», Fox & Pesetsky 2005) nor a sufficient distributive cue. On the other hand, we suggest that the second property (hierarchy) should be reconciled with a specific notion of time in order to solve fruitfully most of the anaphoric binding puzzles we discuss. © 2018 Società editrice il Mulino S.p.

This leads to simpler and more transparent solutions for establishing non-local dependencies both for wh-argumental configurations and for anaphoric pronominal coreference. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

The focalization structure, however, interacts in a non-trivial way with the thematic structure and its accessibility, suggesting a general (independent) prominence of the direct object (DO) over the indirect one (IO). In correlation to that, we also observed that DO appears more resistant to extraction compared to IO, while it seems felicitous in a post-IO focalized low position (light NP-shifting). These contrasts are obtained by running five distinct experiments in Italian targeting various dislocation configurations: Four forced choice tasks manipulating leftward dislocation (i) clefting versus (ii) fronting versus (iii) clitic left dislocation and (iv) postverbal reordering (canonical DO IO order vs. IO DO) in ditransitive predicates. Then (v) an acceptability judgment study was administered to assess the difficulty in figuring out a licensing context coherent with the argument ordering, provided in the why-question. To minimize the interacting factors, all sentences included null subjects and a context was provided for each experimental item in the forced choice tasks, introducing the relevant contrast classes.  © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","clefting; ClLD; contrast class; focalization; forced-choice task; fronting; light NP-shift; topicalization; why-question; word order","","Achinstein P., The Nature of Explanation, (1983); Ariel M., Accessing Noun-phrase Antecedents, (1990); Ariel M., The function of accessibility in a theory of grammar, Journal of Pragmatics, 16, 5, pp. 443-463, (1991); Avesani C., Vayra M., Broad, narrow and contrastive focus in Florentine Italian, 15th International Congress of Phonetic Sciences, pp. 1803-1806, (2003); Baayen R.H., Davidson D.J., Bates D.M., Mixed-effects modeling with crossed random effects for subjects and items, Journal of Memory and Language, 59, 4, pp. 390-412, (2008); Barr D.J., Levy R., Scheepers C., Tily H.J., Random effects structure for confirmatory hypothesis testing: Keep it maximal, Journal of Memory and Language, 68, 3, pp. 255-278, (2013); Belletti A., Rizzi L., Aspects of the low IP area, The Structure of CP and IP.

The prevalence of linguistic deficits and the linguistic profile in PSP patients who present primarily with a movement disorder is unknown. In the present study, we investigated speech and language performance in a sample of clinically diagnosed PSP patients using a comprehensive language battery, including, besides traditional language tests, a detailed analysis of connected speech (picture description task assessing 26 linguistic features). The aim was to identify the most affected linguistic levels in seventeen PSP with a movement disorder presentation, compared to 21 patients with Parkinson's disease and 27 healthy controls. Machine learning methods were used to detect the most relevant language tests and linguistic features characterizing the language profile of PSP patients. Our results indicate that even non-clinically aphasic PSP patients have subtle language deficits, in particular involving the lexical-semantic and discourse levels. Patients with the Richardson's syndrome showed a lower performance in the word comprehension task with respect to the other PSP phenotypes with predominant frontal presentation, parkinsonism and progressive gait freezing. The present findings support the usefulness of a detailed language assessment in all patients in the PSP spectrum. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Connected speech; Language; Machine learning; Progressive supranuclear palsy; Richardson's syndrome","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Language; Language Tests; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Speech; Supranuclear Palsy, Progressive; adult; aged; Article; comprehension; controlled study; female; freezing of gait; human; language; language test; linguistics; machine learning; major clinical study; male; neuropsychological test; Parkinson disease; parkinsonism; postsynaptic potential; primary progressive aphasia; progressive supranuclear palsy; middle aged; physiology; progressive supranuclear palsy; psychology; speech; very elderly","Alberici A., Geroldi C., Cotelli M., Adorni A., Calabria M., Rossi G., Kertesz A., The Frontal Behavioural Inventory (Italian version) differentiates frontotemporal lobar degeneration variants from Alzheimer's disease, Neurological Sciences, 28, 2, pp. 80-86, (2007); Ash S., Grossman M., Why study connected speech production?, Cognitive neuroscience of natural language use, pp. 29-58, (2015); Ash S., McMillan C., Gross R.G., Cook P., Gunawardena D., Morgan B., Grossman M., Impairments of speech fluency in Lewy body spectrum disorder, Brain and Language, 120, 3, pp. 290-302, (2012); Ash S., McMillan C., Gross R.G., Cook P., Morgan B., Boller A., Grossman M., The organization of narrative discourse in Lewy body spectrum disorder, Brain and Language, 119, 1, pp. 30-41, (2011); Ash S., Xie S.X., Gross R.G., Dreyfuss M., Boller A., Camp E., Et al., The organization and anatomy of narrative comprehension and expression in Lewy body spectrum disorders, Neuropsychology, 26, (2012); Bak T.H., Yancopoulou D., Nestor P.J., Xuereb J.H., Spillantini M.G., Pulvermuller F., Et al., Clinical, imaging and pathological correlates of a hereditary deficit in verb and action processing, Brain, 129, 2, pp. 321-332, (2005); Battista P., Catricala E., Piccininni M., Copetti M., Esposito V., Polito C., Picillo M., Screening for aphasia in NeuroDegeneration for the diagnosis of patients with primary progressive aphasia: Clinical validity and psychometric properties, Dementia and Geriatric Cognitive Disorders, 46, 3-4, pp. 243-252, (2018); Benton A.L., Varney N.R., deS Hamsher K., Visuospatial judgment: A clinical test, Archives of Neurology, 35, 6, pp. 364-367, (1978); Boeve B., Dickson D., Duffy J., Bartleson J., Trenerry M., Petersen R., Progressive nonfluent aphasia and subsequent aphasic dementia associated with atypical progressive supranuclear palsy pathology, European Neurology, 49, pp. 72-78, (2003); Boschi V., Catricala E., Consonni M., Chesi C., Moro A., Cappa S.F., Connected speech in neurodegenerative language disorders: A review, Frontiers in Psychology, 8, (2017); Burrell J.R., Ballard K.J., Halliday G.M., Hodges J.R., Aphasia in progressive supranuclear palsy: As severe as progressive non-fluent aphasia, Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, pp. 1-11, (2018); Burrell J.R., Hodges J.R., Rowe J.B., Cognition in corticobasal syndrome and progressive supranuclear palsy: A review, Movement Disorders, 29, 5, pp. 684-693, (2014); Caffarra P., Vezzadini G., Dieci F., Zonato F., Venneri A., Rey-osterrieth complex figure: Normative values in an Italian population sample, Neurological Sciences, 22, 6, pp. 443-447, (2002); Caffarra P., Vezzadini G., Dieci F., Zonato F., Venneri A., Una versione abbreviata del test di Stroop, Nuova Rivista di Neurologia, 12, 4, pp. 111-115, (2002); Carlesimo G.A., Caltagirone C., Gainotti G.U.I.D., Fadda L., Gallassi R., Lorusso S., Parnetti L., The mental deterioration battery: Normative data, diagnostic reliability and qualitative analyses of cognitive impairment, European Neurology, 36, 6, pp. 378-384, (1996); Caso F., Agosta F., Volonte M.A., Ferraro P.M., Tiraboschi P., Copetti M., Filippi M., Cognitive impairment in progressive supranuclear palsy-Richardson's syndrome is related to white matter damage, Parkinsonism and Related Disorders, 31, pp. 65-71, (2016); Catricala E., Gobbi E., Battista P., Miozzo A., Polito C., Boschi V., Garrard P., SAND: A screening for aphasia in NeuroDegeneration.

Our approach focuses on the integration of specific linguistic features and surprisal-based metrics for both Italian and Spanish datasets (CItA and COWS-L2H, respectively). With our tests the system achieves a F-score of 0.67 for the Italian test set and 0.75 for the Spanish test set.

Using acceptability judgments, we first tested wh- sub-extraction from both determiner phrases (DPs) in both configurations. We then collected acceptability for the same sentences without involving sub-extraction, and compared these results with the acceptability of pre- and post-verbal subject placement in transitive, unergative and unaccusative predicates. We observed the following. (i) Sub-extractions from predicates in canonical form are the most acceptable. (ii) In the remaining conditions, sub-extractions from predicates are more acceptable than those from subjects, and those from canonical are more acceptable than those from inverse NC sentences. The preference for canonical NC sentences is also confirmed when sub-extraction is absent. (iii) There is a general preference for pre-verbal subjects with all verbal predicates (especially strong in transitive and unergative predicates, milder with unaccusatives). The best acceptability results obtained with sub-extraction from predicates in canonical form are in line with the unified theory; the necessity to occupy a pre-verbal position for (presuppositional) subjects captures all the major remaining contrasts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Acceptability judgement paradigm; Copular sentences; Predicative structures","","Baayen R.H., Davidson D.J., Bates D.M., Mixed-effects modeling with crossed random effects for subjects and items, Journal of Memory and Language, 59, pp. 390-412, (2008); Bates D., Maechler M., Bolker B., Walker S., Fitting linear mixed-effects models using lme4, Journal of Statistical Software, 67, 1, pp. 1-48, (2015); Belletti A., The case of unaccusatives, Linguistic Inquiry, 19, pp. 1-34, (1988); Belletti A., Aspects of the low IP area, The Structure of CP and IP: The Cartography of Syntactic Structures, 2, pp. 16-51, (2004); Belletti A., Shlonsky U., The order of verbal complements: a comparative study, Natural Language and Linguistic Theory, 13, pp. 489-526, (1995); Bianchi V., Chesi C., Subject Islands, Reconstruction, and the Flow of the Computation, Linguistic Inquiry, 4, pp. 525-569, (2014); Bocci G., The Syntax-Prosody Interface from a Cartographic Perspective: Evidence from Italian, (2013); Bowers J., The syntax of predication, Linguistic Inquiry, 24, pp. 591-656, (1993); Burzio L., Italian Syntax: A GB Approach, (1986); Cardinaletti A., Toward a cartography of subject positions, The Structure of CP and IP: The Cartography of Syntactic Structures, 2, pp. 115-165, (2004); Cardinaletti A., Guasti M.T., Syntax and Semantics (Vol. 28): Small Clauses, (1995); Cardinaletti A., Roberts I., Levels of representation of agreemen, Talk given at the XIII GLOW Conference, St. John's College, Cambridge, UK, (1990); Chesi C., On directionality of phrase structure building, Journal of Psychological Research, 44, pp. 65-89, (2015); Chesi C., Canal P., Person features and lexical restrictions in Italian Clefts, Frontiers in Psychology, (2019); Chomsky N., Barriers, (1986); Chomsky N., Problems of projection, Lingua, 18, pp. 1-35, (2013); Cinque G., Left dislocation: a syntactic and pragmatic analysis.

Here we analyze the written production of three profoundly deaf children elic-ited during 85 interactive sessions (this roughly corresponds to 85 hours of exercises and free written productions) of the Logogenia method. This method crucially uses minimal pairs to bring the attention of the child on the relevant morphosyntactic and semantic oppositions without explicitly offering any grammatical explanation.

The task featured two sub-tasks articulated as: (i) binary prediction task and (ii) regression task, predicting the acceptability in a continuous scale. The sentences were artificially generated in three languages (English, Italian and French). 21 systems, with 8 system papers were submitted for the task, all based on various types of fine-tuned transformer systems, often with ensemble methods and various data augmentation techniques. The best systems reached an F1-macro score of 94.49 (sub-task1) and a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.80 (sub-task2), with interesting variations in specific constructions and/or languages. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Augmentation techniques; Continuous scale; Data augmentation; Ensemble methods; Neural-networks; Prediction tasks; Semantics knowledge; Simple++; Subtask; Transformer systems; Semantics","Aziz Abdul, Hossain Md.

Annotation is mostly assumed to be a straightforward task: as long as the annotation scheme is well defined and the guidelines are clear, annotators are expected to agree on the labels. This is not always the case, especially in legal annotation, which can be extremely difficult even for expert annotators. We propose a legal annotation procedure that takes into account annotator certainty and improves it through negotiation. We also collect annotator feedback and show that our approach contributes to a positive annotation environment. Our work invites reflection on often neglected ethical concerns regarding legal annotation. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Annotation scheme; Case law; Ethical concerns; Legal corpus;

It is a natural way of interaction and it is easy to use by people in general. The development of speech enabled applications is a big challenge that increases if several languages are required, a common scenario, for example, in Europe. Tackling this challenge requires the proposal of methods and tools that foster easier deployment of speech features, harnessing developers with versatile means to include speech interaction in their applications. Besides, only a reduced variety of voices are available (sometimes only one per language) which raises problems regarding the fulfillment of user preferences and hinders a deeper exploration regarding voices’ adequacy to specific applications and users. In this article, we present some of our contributions to these different issues: (a) our generic modality that encapsulates the technical details of using speech synthesis; (b) the process followed to create four new voices, including two young adult and two elderly voices; and (c) some initial results exploring user preferences regarding the created voices. The preliminary studies carried out targeted groups including both young and older-adults and addressed: (a) evaluation of the intrinsic properties of each voice; (b) observation of users while using speech enabled interfaces and elicitation of qualitative impressions regarding the chosen voice and the impact of speech interaction on user satisfaction; and (c) ranking of voices according to preference. The collected results, albeit preliminary, yield some evidence of the positive impact speech interaction has on users, at different levels. Additionally, results show interesting differences among the voice preferences expressed by both age groups and genders. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Age effects; Multimodal interaction; Speech output; Synthetic voices","Computational linguistics; Speech; Speech synthesis; User interfaces; Age effects; Intrinsic property; Multi-Modal Interactions; Multimodal application; Speech interaction; Speech output; Synthetic voices; User satisfaction; Human computer interaction","Bijani C., White B.-K., Vilrokx M., Giving voice to enterprise mobile applications, Proceedings of the 15Th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices and Services - Mobilehci 2013, (2013); Nass C., Brave S., Wired for Speech: How Voice Activates and Advances the Human-Computer Relationship, (2007); McCoy S.L., Tun P., Cox L., Wingate A., Aging in a fast-paced world: Rapid speech and its effect on understanding, ASHA Lead, 12, pp. 30-31, (2005); Gordon-Salant S., Et al., Sources of age-related recognition difficulty for time-compressed speech, J.

Here we show that example-based MT tools (e.g. Google Translate) as well as other NLP tools (UDpipe, LinguA, Stanford Parser, and Google Cloud AI API) fail in capturing the critical distinctions between the two structures in the end producing both wrong analyses and, possibly as a consequence of a non-coherent (or missing) structural analysis, incorrect translations in the case of MT tools. To support the proposed analysis, we present also an empirical study showing that native speakers are indeed sensitive to the critical distinctions. This poses a sharp challenge for NLP tools that aim at being cognitively plausible or at least descriptively adequate (Chowdhury & Zamparelli 2018).

The analysis of extended speech production is a precious source of information encompassing the phonetic, phonological, lexico-semantic, morpho-syntactic, and pragmatic levels of language organization. The knowledge about the distinctive linguistic variables identifying language deficits associated to different neurodegenerative diseases has progressively improved in the last years. However, the heterogeneity of such variables and of the way they are measured and classified limits any generalization and makes the comparison among studies difficult. Here we present an exhaustive review of the studies focusing on the linguistic variables derived from the analysis of connected speech samples, with the aim of characterizing the language disorders of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, including primary progressive aphasia, Alzheimer's disease, movement disorders, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A total of 61 studies have been included, considering only those reporting group analysis and comparisons with a group of healthy persons. This review first analyzes the differences in the tasks used to elicit connected speech, namely picture description, story narration, and interview, considering the possible different contributions to the assessment of different linguistic domains. This is followed by an analysis of the terminologies and of the methods of measurements of the variables, indicating the need for harmonization and standardization. The final section reviews the linguistic domains affected by each different neurodegenerative disease, indicating the variables most consistently impaired at each level and suggesting the key variables helping in the differential diagnosis among diseases. While a large amount of valuable information is already available, the review highlights the need of further work, including the development of automated methods, to take advantage of the richness of connected speech analysis for both research and clinical purposes. © 2017 Boschi, Catricalà, Consonni, Chesi, Moro and Cappa.","Connected speech; Interview; Linguistic domains; Linguistic variables; Neurodegenerative disorders; Picture description; Review; Story narration","","Aarsland D., Litvan I., Salmon D., Galasko D., Wentzel-Larsen T., Larsen J.P., Performance on the dementia rating scale in Parkinson's disease with dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies: comparison with progressive supranuclear palsy and Alzheimer's disease, J.

MIT Press, Cambridge, 1995) led to simpler linguistic devices and a better focalization of the core properties of the structure building engine: a lexicon and a free (recursive) phrase formation operation, dubbed Merge, are the basic components that serve in building syntactic structures. Here I suggest that by looking at the elementary restrictions that apply to Merge (i.e., selection and licensing of functional features), we could conclude that a re-orientation of the syntactic derivation (from bottom-up/right-left to top-down/left-right) is necessary to make the theory simpler, especially for long-distance (filler-gap) dependencies, and is also empirically more adequate. If the structure building operations would assemble lexical items in the order they are pronounced (Phillips in Order and structure.

Focusing on Italian, we annotated part of the Repubblica Corpus to attempt an automatic classification of the reflexive and impersonal si constructions. In this preliminary study we show that the accuracy of the automatic classification methods that do not use any relevant structural information are rather modest. A thoughtful discussion of the structural analysis required to distinguish among different contexts is provided, in the end suggesting that these structural configurations are not easily recoverable using a purely distributional approach.

We highlight the importance of coherence modeling in natural language processing tasks and briefly discuss related work, including earlier linguistic theories and recent neural models. To tackle the task, we leverage pre-trained Transformer models and fine-tune them on the provided datasets. Our approach incorporates monolingual models due to limited computing resources, but shows potential for multilingual and multitask learning. Our systems ranks second overall, showing that Transformer models can be fruitfully leveraged for coherence assessment, but more work is needed to fully exploit their capabilities. The coherence assessment literature focuses primarily on English; this shared task and our work contribute to broadening the scope of current research. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

The first assumption is that a realistic natural language parser must assign incoming words incrementally into the syntactic representation as it is built during the parsing process. The second assumption is that this process makes use of Merge, the core recursive operation in syntax. These assumptions lead us to consider an extension of the standard theory of Merge, in which phrase structure is derived from a linear string of words in a left-to-right/top-down fashion (e.g. Phillips, 1996, 2003). We propose a generalization of the Phillips architecture that describes and correctly parses simple and complex pied-piping constructions in three languages: English, Italian and Finnish. We then show that the proposed hypothesis derives (without any additional assumptions) several well-known constraints to pied-piping and operator movement, such as Condition on Extraction Domains (CED), the Left Branch Condition, the extended projection principle (EPP), the complex properties of picture nouns and certain differences between relative and interrogative clauses. A computational implementation and full formalization of the hypothesis together with a test corpus is used to demonstrate the viability of the approach. We conclude that the top-down approach provides a useful tool for grammatical analysis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Parser grammar; Parsing; Pied-piping; Top-down grammar; Wh-movement","","Abney S.P., Johnson M., Memory requirements and local ambiguities of parsing strategies, J.

The resources were developed in the context of a collaborative citizenship project led by Microsoft, in the context of the creation of the first TTS system for Mirandese. Development efforts encompassed the compilation of a corpus with over 1M tokens, the construction of a GTP system, syllable-division, inflection and a Part-of-Speech (POS) tagger modules, leading to the creation of an inflected lexicon of about 200.000 entries with phonetic transcription, detailed POS tagging, syllable division, and stress mark-up. Alongside these tasks, which were made easier through the adaptation and reuse of existing tools for closely related languages, a casting for voice talents among the speaking community was conducted and the first speech database for speech synthesis was recorded for Mirandese. These resources were combined to fulfil the requirements of a well-tested statistical parameter synthesis model, leading to an intelligible voice font. These language resources are available freely at Casa de la Lhéngua, aiming at promoting the development of real-life applications and fostering linguistic research on Mirandese.","Language resources; Lexical database; Minority language; Mirandese; Speech synthesis","Computational linguistics; Linguistics; Speech synthesis; Language resources; Lexical database; Minority languages; Mirandese; Phonetic transcriptions; Real-life applications; Speech database; Statistical parameters; Natural language processing systems","Barros Ferreira M., O mirandês, língua minoritária, Uma Política de Língua para o Português, pp. 137-145, (2002); Beckman M.E., Hirschberg J., The ToBI Annotation Conventions, (1994); Braga D., Campillo F., Dias M.S., Garcia-Mateo C., Mendez F., Mourin A., Silva P., Building high quality databases for minority languages such as galician, Proceedings of LREC'10, pp. 113-116, (2010); Braga D., Coelho L., Resende F.G., Dias M., Subjective and objective evaluation of Brazilian Portuguese TT S voice font quality, Advances in Speech Technology - Proceedings of the 14th International Workshop, pp. 129-138, (2008); Branco A., Mendes A., Pereira S., Henriques P., Pellegrini T., Meinedo H., Trancoso I., Quaresma P.S., De Lima V.L., The Portuguese Language in the Digital Age, (2012); Caseiro A., Trancoso D., Guerreiro I.C.M., Ribeiro V., Barros M., A comparative description of GtoP modules for Portuguese and Mirandese using finite state transducers, ICPhS'2003-15th International Congress of Phonetic Sciences, (2003); Chesi C., Baldewijns D., Hyongsil C., Braga D., Sales Dias M., A TN/ITN framework for Western European languages, Abstract Proc. of CLIN21, (2011); Cho H., Braga D., Chesi C., Baldewijns D., Ribeiro M., Saarinen K., Beck J., Rustullet S., Henriksson P., Dias M., Rahmel H., A multi-lingual TN/ITN framework for speech technology, Proceedings of FALA 2010, pp. 213-216, (2010); Ferreira A., Ferreira J.P., Dicionário Mirandês-Português, (2001); Ferreira J.P., Cho H., Braga D., Silva P., Dias M., A guided quest for a spoken standard, Ethics and Methodology in Discourse Interaction Research, (2011); Ferreira J.P., Cho H., Braga D., Silva P., Dias M., Acoustic notes on stressed Mirandese vowels, Phonetics and Phonology in Iberia 2011, (2011); Garcia M., Gamallo P., Análise Morfossintáctica para o Português Europeu e Galego: Problemas, Soluções e Avaliação, Linguamática, 2, 2, pp. 59-67, (2010); Janssen M., NeoTag: A POS tagger for grammatical neologism detection, Proceedings of LREC'12, pp. 2118-2124, (2012); Leite Vasconcelos J., Lições de Filologia Mirandesa, (1899); Ratnaparkhi A., A maximum entropy model for part-of-speech tagging, Proc.

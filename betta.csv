However, which mechanisms link descriptions of affective states to brain activity is unclear, with evidence supporting either local or distributed processing. A biologically favorable alternative is provided by the notion of gradient, which postulates the isomorphism between functional representations of stimulus features and cortical distance. Here, we use fMRI activity evoked by an emotionally charged movie and continuous ratings of the perceived emotion intensity to reveal the topographic organization of affective states. Results show that three orthogonal and spatially overlapping gradients encode the polarity, complexity and intensity of emotional experiences in right temporo-parietal territories. The spatial arrangement of these gradients allows the brain to map a variety of affective states within a single patch of cortex. As this organization resembles how sensory regions represent psychophysical properties (e.g., retinotopy), we propose emotionotopy as a principle of emotion coding. © 2019, The Author(s).","","Adult; Attention; Brain; Brain Mapping; Emotions; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Parietal Lobe; Photic Stimulation; Young Adult; brain; complexity; digital map; neurology; physiological response; spatial analysis; ambivalence; anger; Article; behavior assessment; BOLD signal; brain mapping; cell polarity; disgust; electroencephalogram; emotion; emotionality; emotionotopy; fear; Fourier transform; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; happiness; hemodynamics; human; nerve stimulation; psychophysiology; sadness; social cognition; spectroscopy; superior temporal sulcus; temporoparietal junction; topography; adult; anatomy and histology; attention; brain; diagnostic imaging; female; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; parietal lobe; photostimulation; physiology; procedures; young adult","Panksepp J., Toward a general psychobiological theory of emotions, Behav.

Although this effect has been convincingly demonstrated for the sensorimotor domain, attempts to extend these findings to the visual system have provided mixed results. In this study we asked whether depriving subjects of external visual stimuli during daytime would lead to regional changes in slow waves during sleep and whether the degree of “internal visual stimulation” (spontaneous imagery) would influence such changes. In two 8-h sessions spaced 1 wk apart, 12 healthy volunteers either were blindfolded while listening to audiobooks or watched movies (control condition), after which their sleep was recorded with high-density EEG. We found that during NREM sleep, the number of small, local slow waves in the occipital cortex decreased after listening with blindfolding relative to movie watching in a way that depended on the degree of visual imagery subjects reported during blindfolding: subjects with low visual imagery showed a significant reduction of occipital sleep slow waves, whereas those who reported a high degree of visual imagery did not. We also found a positive relationship between the reliance on visual imagery during blindfolding and audiobook listening and the degree of correlation in sleep SWA between visual areas and language-related areas. These preliminary results demonstrate that short-term alterations in visual experience may trigger slow-wave changes in cortical visual areas. Furthermore, they suggest that plasticity- related EEG changes during sleep may reflect externally induced (“bottom up”) visual experiences, as well as internally generated (“top down”) processes. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Previous work has shown that slow-wave activity, a marker of sleep depth, is linked to neural plasticity in the sensorimotor cortex. We show that after short-term visual deprivation, subjects who reported little visual imagery had a reduced incidence of occipital slow waves. This effect was absent in subjects who reported strong spontaneous visual imagery. These findings suggest that visual imagery may “substitute” for visual perception and induce similar changes in non-rapid eye movement slow waves. © 2019 the American Physiological Society.","High-density eeg; NREM; Plasticity; Slow wave; Visual imagery","Adult; Brain Waves; Female; Humans; Imagination; Male; Occipital Lobe; Sensory Deprivation; Sleep, Slow-Wave; Speech Perception; Visual Perception; Young Adult; adult; alertness; Article; cingulate gyrus; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; electroencephalogram; human; human experiment; imagery; middle temporal gyrus; mood; nonREM sleep; normal human; occipital cortex; pilot study; precuneus; priority journal; psychomotor vigilance task; sensorimotor cortex; sleep; sleep latency; sleep quality; sleep time; somnolence; stage 1 sleep; superior parietal lobule; superior temporal gyrus; vision; visual deprivation; visual hallucination; visual stimulation; visual system; electroencephalogram; female; imagination; male; occipital lobe; physiology; sensory deprivation; speech perception; vision; young adult","Achermann P., Borbely A.A., Mathematical models of sleep regulation, Front Biosci, 8, pp. s683-s693, (2003); Agnew H.W., Webb W.B., Williams R.L., The first night effect: An EEG study of sleep, Psychophysiology, 2, pp. 263-266, (1966); Anderer P., Saletu B., Fundamentals of low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography, Neuroimaging of Sleep and Sleep Disorders, pp. 72-81, (2013); Bang J.W., Khalilzadeh O., Hamalainen M., Watanabe T., Sasaki Y., Location specific sleep spindle activity in the early visual areas and perceptual learning, Vision Res, 99, pp. 162-171, (2014); Benjamini Y., Hochberg Y., Controlling the false discovery rate: A practical and powerful approach to multiple testing, J R Stat Soc B, 57, pp. 289-300, (1995); Bernardi G., Cecchetti L., Siclari F., Buchmann A., Yu X., Handjaras G., Bellesi M., Ricciardi E., Kecskemeti S.R., Riedner B.A., Alexander A.L., Benca R.M., Ghilardi M.F., Pietrini P., Cirelli C., Tononi G., Sleep reverts changes in human gray and white matter caused by wake-dependent training, Neuroimage, 129, pp. 367-377, (2016); Bernardi G., Siclari F., Handjaras G., Riedner B.A., Tononi G., Local and widespread slow waves in stable NREM sleep: Evidence for distinct regulation mechanisms, Front Hum Neurosci, 12, (2018); Bernardi G., Siclari F., Yu X., Zennig C., Bellesi M., Ricciardi E., Cirelli C., Ghilardi M.F., Pietrini P., Tononi G., Neural and behavioral correlates of extended training during sleep deprivation in humans: Evidence for local, task-specific effects, J Neurosci, 35, pp. 4487-4500, (2015); Boroojerdi B., Battaglia F., Muellbacher W., Cohen L.G., Mechanisms underlying rapid experience-dependent plasticity in the human visual cortex, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 98, pp. 14698-14701, (2001); Boroojerdi B., Bushara K.O., Corwell B., Immisch I., Battaglia F., Muellbacher W., Cohen L.G., Enhanced excitability of the human visual cortex induced by short-term light deprivation, Cereb Cortex, 10, pp. 529-534, (2000); Buysse D.J., Reynolds C.F., Monk T.H., Berman S.R., Kupfer D.J., The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: A new instrument for psychiatric practice and research, Psychiatry Res, 28, pp. 193-213, (1989); Castelnovo A., Riedner B.A., Smith R.F., Tononi G., Boly M., Benca R.M., Scalp and source power topography in sleepwalking and sleep terrors: A high-density EEG study, Sleep (Basel), 39, pp. 1815-1825, (2016); Cattaneo Z., Vecchi T., Cornoldi C., Mammarella I., Bonino D., Ricciardi E., Pietrini P., Imagery and spatial processes in blindness and visual impairment, Neurosci Biobehav Rev, 32, pp. 1346-1360, (2008); Cecchetti L., Kupers R., Ptito M., Pietrini P., Ricciardi E., Are supramodality and cross-modal plasticity the yin and yang of brain development?

Relevant features span from simple low-level properties, as contrast and spatial frequencies, to object-based attributes, as shape and category. However, how these features are integrated into coherent percepts is still debated. Moreover, these dimensions often share common biases: for instance, stimuli from the same category (e.g., tools) may have similar shapes. Here, using magnetoencephalography, we revealed the temporal dynamics of feature processing in human subjects attending to objects from six semantic categories. By employing Relative Weights Analysis, we mitigated collinearity between model-based descriptions of stimuli and showed that low-level properties (contrast and spatial frequencies), shape (medial-axis) and category are represented within the same spatial locations early in time: 100–150 ms after stimulus onset. This fast and overlapping processing may result from independent parallel computations, with categorical representation emerging later than the onset of low-level feature processing, yet before shape coding. Categorical information is represented both before and after shape, suggesting a role for this feature in the refinement of categorical matching. © 2019, The Author(s).","","adult; article; human; magnetoencephalography; stimulus","Malcolm G.L., Groen I.I.A., Baker C.I., Making Sense of Real-World Scenes, Trends Cogn Sci, 20, pp. 843-856, (2016); Olshausen B.A., Field D.J., Emergence of simple-cell receptive field properties by learning a sparse code for natural images, Nature, 381, pp. 607-609, (1996); Vinje W.E., Gallant J.L., Sparse coding and decorrelation in primary visual cortex during natural vision, Science, 287, pp. 1273-1276, (2000); Rice G.E., Watson D.M., Hartley T., Andrews T.J., Low-level image properties of visual objects predict patterns of neural response across category-selective regions of the ventral visual pathway, J Neurosci, 34, pp. 8837-8844, (2014); Groen I.I., Et al., Distinct contributions of functional and deep neural network features to representational similarity of scenes in human brain and behavior, Elife, 7, (2018); Lescroart M.D., Biederman I., Cortical representation of medial axis structure, Cereb Cortex, 23, pp. 629-637, (2013); Carlson E.T., Rasquinha R.J., Zhang K., Connor C.E., A sparse object coding scheme in area V4, Curr Biol, 21, pp. 288-293, (2011); Hung C.C., Carlson E.T., Connor C.E., Medial axis shape coding in macaque inferotemporal cortex, Neuron, 74, pp. 1099-1113, (2012); Handjaras G., Et al., Modality-independent encoding of individual concepts in the left parietal cortex, Neuropsychologia, 105, pp. 39-49, (2017); Haxby J.V., Et al., Distributed and overlapping representations of faces and objects in ventral temporal cortex, Science, 293, pp. 2425-2430, (2001); Kriegeskorte N., Et al., Matching categorical object representations in inferior temporal cortex of man and monkey, Neuron, 60, pp. 1126-1141, (2008); Handjaras G., Et al., How concepts are encoded in the human brain: A modality independent, category-based cortical organization of semantic knowledge, NeuroImage, 135, pp. 232-242, (2016); Kay K.N., Understanding Visual Representation by Developing Receptive-Field Models.

Methods and Results-Twenty patients with systolic heart failure (age, 72.4±6.4 years; left ventricular ejection fraction, 31.5±5.8%), 10 with relevant CSR (24-hour apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] ≥10 events/h) and 10 without (AHI <10 events/h) at 24-hour cardiorespiratory monitoring underwent evaluation of chemoreflex gain (CG) to hypoxia (CGO2) and hypercapnia (CGCO2) by rebreathing technique, lung-to-finger circulation time, and PG assessment through a visual system. PG test was feasible andreproducible (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91-0.99); the best-fitting curve to express the PG was a hyperbola (R2≥0.98). Patients with CSR showed increased PG, CGCO2 (but not CGO2), and lung-to-finger circulation time, compared with patients without CSR (all P<0.05). PG was the only predictor of the daytime AHI (R=0.56, P=0.01) and together with the CGCO2 also predicted the nighttime AHI (R=0.81, P=0.0003) and the 24-hour AHI (R=0.71, P=0.001). Lung-to-finger circulation time was the only predictor of CSR cycle length (R=0.82, P=0.00006). Conclusions-PG is a powerful contributor of CSR and should be evaluated together with the CG and circulation time to individualize treatments aimed at stabilizing breathing in heart failure. © 2019 The Authors.

It is unknown what underlies sleep misperception, as standard polysomnographic (PSG) parameters are often normal in these cases. Here we asked whether regional changes in brain activity could account for the mismatch between objective and subjective total sleep times (TST). To set cutoffs and define the norm, we first evaluated sleep perception in a population-based sample, consisting of 2,092 individuals who underwent a full PSG at home and estimated TST the next day. We then compared participants with a low mismatch (normoestimators, n = 1,147, ±0.5 SD of mean) with those who severely underestimated (n = 52, <2.5th percentile) or overestimated TST (n = 53, >97.5th percentile). Compared with normoestimators, underestimators displayed higher electroencephalographic (EEG) activation (beta/delta power ratio) in both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, while overestimators showed lower EEG activation (significant in REM sleep). To spatially map these changes, we performed a second experiment, in which 24 healthy subjects and 10 insomnia patients underwent high-density sleep EEG recordings. Similarly to underestimators, patients displayed increased EEG activation during NREM sleep, which we localized to central-posterior brain areas. Our results indicate that a relative shift from low- to high-frequency spectral power in central-posterior brain regions, not readily apparent in conventional PSG parameters, is associated with underestimation of sleep duration. This challenges the concept of sleep misperception, and suggests that instead of misperceiving sleep, insomnia patients may correctly perceive subtle shifts toward wake-like brain activity. Statement of Significance A striking mismatch between subjectively perceived and objectively recorded sleep times sometimes occurs in good sleepers and to an extreme degree in patients with so-called paradoxical insomnia. Here we show that individuals who underestimate their total sleep time display a more “wake-like,” activated electroencephalography, while opposite changes are observed in rapid eye movement sleep in subjects who overestimate their sleep time. These findings challenge the concept of sleep misperception, and suggest that instead of misperceiving their sleep duration, insomnia patients may actually correctly perceive subtle shifts toward wake-like brain activity. © Sleep Research Society 2020.

Interestingly, both methods have been shown to detect relative alterations of brain functional connectivity in conditions associated with changes in the level of consciousness, such as following severe brain injury or under anaesthesia. Despite these promising findings, it was unclear whether wPLI and wSMI may account for distinct or similar types of functional interactions. Using simulated high-density (hd-)EEG data, we demonstrate that, while wPLI has high sensitivity for couplings presenting a mixture of linear and nonlinear interdependencies, only wSMI can detect purely nonlinear interaction dynamics. Moreover, we evaluated the potential impact of these differences on real experimental data by computing wPLI and wSMI connectivity in hd-EEG recordings of 12 healthy adults during wakefulness and deep (N3-)sleep, characterised by different levels of consciousness. In line with the simulation-based findings, this analysis revealed that both methods have different sensitivity for changes in brain connectivity across the two vigilance states. Our results indicate that the conjoint use of wPLI and wSMI may represent a powerful tool to study the functional bases of consciousness in physiological and pathological conditions. © 2019, The Author(s).","","Adult; Brain; Consciousness; Electroencephalography; Female; Humans; Male; Nonlinear Dynamics; adult; brain; consciousness; electroencephalography; female; human; male; nonlinear system; physiology; procedures","Vinck M., Oostenveld R., Van Wingerden M., Battaglia F., Pennartz C.M.A., An improved index of phase-synchronization for electrophysiological data in the presence of volume-conduction, noise and sample-size bias, Neuroimage, 55, pp. 1548-1565, (2011); Srinivasan R., Winter W.R., Ding J., Nunez P.L., EEG and MEG coherence: Measures of functional connectivity at distinct spatial scales of neocortical dynamics, J.

With modern literature arguing against unique roles for these cortical regions, different theories have favored either neural code-sharing or cortical space-sharing, thus trying to explain the intertwined spatial and functional organization of motor and acoustic components across the fronto-temporal cortical network. In this context, the focus of attention has recently shifted toward specific model fitting, aimed at motor and/or acoustic space reconstruction in brain activity within the language network. Here, we tested a model based on acoustic properties (formants), and one based on motor properties (articulation parameters), where model-free decoding of evoked fMRI activity during perception, imagery, and production of vowels had been successful. Results revealed that phonological information organizes around formant structure during the perception of vowels; interestingly, such a model was reconstructed in a broad temporal region, outside of the primary auditory cortex, but also in the pars triangularis of the left inferior frontal gyrus. Conversely, articulatory features were not associated with brain activity in these regions.

To emulate blood clotting and the pathological condition of hemophilia, a mathematical model composed by 14 ordinary differential equations is considered. We adopt a variable structure non-linear PID approach and a Model Predictive Control in order to control the dosage of procoagulant factor used in the treatment of hemophiliac patient. The two control actions are sampled for a practical application.

Objective: To investigate the value of pulse wave amplitude drops (PWADs), reflecting sympathetic activations and vasoreactivity, as a biomarker of cardiovascular risk in OSA. Methods: PWADs were derived from pulse oximetry-based photoplethysmography signals in three prospective cohorts: HypnoLaus (N = 1, 941), the Pays-de-la-Loire Sleep Cohort (PLSC; N = 6, 367), and “Impact of Sleep Apnea syndrome in the evolution of Acute Coronary syndrome. Effect of intervention with CPAP” (ISAACC) (N = 692). The PWAD index was the number of PWADs (>30%) per hour during sleep. All participants were divided into subgroups according to the presence or absence of OSA (defined as >15 or more events per hour or <15/h, respectively, on the apnea-hypopnea index) and the median PWAD index. Primary outcome was the incidence of composite cardiovascular events. Measurements and Main Results: Using Cox models adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors (hazard ratio; HR [95% confidence interval]), patients with a low PWAD index and OSA had a higher incidence of cardiovascular events compared with the high-PWAD and OSA group and those without OSA in the HypnoLaus cohort (HR, 2.16 [1.07-4.34], P = 0.031; and 2.35 [1.12-4.93], P = 0.024) and in the PLSC (1.36 [1.13-1.63], P = 0.001; and 1.44 [1.06-1.94], P = 0.019), respectively. In the ISAACC cohort, the low-PWAD and OSA untreated group had a higher cardiovascular event recurrence rate than that of the no-OSA group (2.03 [1.08-3.81], P = 0.028). In the PLSC and HypnoLaus cohorts, every increase of 10 events per hour in the continuous PWAD index was negatively associated with incident cardiovascular events exclusively in patients with OSA (HR, 0.85 [0.73-0.99], P = 0.031; and HR, 0.91 [0.86-0.96], P < 0.001, respectively). This association was not significant in the no-OSA group and the ISAACC cohort. Conclusions: In patients with OSA, a low PWAD index reflecting poor autonomic and vascular reactivity was independently associated with a higher cardiovascular risk.

Importantly, slow waves behave as traveling waves, and their propagation is assumed to occur through cortico-cortical white matter connections. In this light, the corpus callosum (CC) may represent the main responsible for cross-hemispheric slow-wave propagation. To verify this hypothesis, we performed overnight high-density (hd)- EEG recordings in five patients who underwent total callosotomy due to drug-resistant epilepsy (CPs; two females), in three noncallosotomized neurologic patients (NPs; two females), and in a sample of 24 healthy adult subjects (HSs; 13 females). In all CPs slow waves displayed a significantly reduced probability of cross-hemispheric propagation and a stronger interhemispheric asymmetry. In both CPs and HSs, the incidence of large slow waves within individual NREM epochs tended to differ across hemispheres, with a relative overall predominance of the right over the left hemisphere. The absolute magnitude of this asymmetry was greater in CPs relative to HSs. However, the CC resection had no significant effects on the distribution of slow-wave origin probability across hemispheres. The present results indicate that CC integrity is essential for the crosshemispheric traveling of slow waves in human sleep, which is in line with the assumption of a direct relationship between white matter integrity and slow-wave propagation. Our findings also revealed a residual cross-hemispheric slow-wave propagation that may rely on alternative pathways, including cortico-subcortico-cortical loops. Finally, these data indicate that the lack of the CC does not lead to differences in slow-wave generation across brain hemispheres. © 2020 Society for Neuroscience.

Optimal control theory has proven to be a successful tool in understanding ways to curtail the spread of infectious diseases by devising the optimal disease intervention strategies. In this paper, we describe how a reduced ‘toy’ model can extract the essentials of the dynamics of the VZV transmission and reactivation in case of the study of optimal paths of varicella immunization programs. Results obtained using different optimization approaches are compared with the ones of a more realistic age-structured model. The reduced model shows some unreliable predictions in regards of model time scales about herpes zoster dynamic; nevertheless, it is able to reproduce the main qualitative dynamic of the more realistic model to the different optimization problems, while requiring a minimal number of parameters to be identified.

We prospectively investigated the predictors of incident and persistent excessive daytime sleepiness in 2,751 subjects (46.1% men, mean age 56.0 ± 9.8 years) from the CoLaus-PsyCoLaus population-based cohort (Lausanne, Switzerland) over 5 years. Participants completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and underwent a full clinical evaluation at baseline and 5 years afterwards. Ambulatory polysomnography was performed at baseline in a sub-sample of 1,404 subjects. Among the 2,438 subjects without excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale ≤ 10) at baseline, the 5-year incidence of excessive daytime sleepiness was 5.1% (n = 124). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that male sex, depressive symptoms, reported poor sleep quality and moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea were independent predictors of incident excessive daytime sleepiness, while older age, moderate coffee consumption, periodic leg movement during sleep and hypertension were independent protective factors. Stratified analysis according to sex and age showed some distinctive associations. Among the 313 patients with excessive daytime sleepiness at baseline, 137 (43.8%) had persistent excessive daytime sleepiness 5 years later. Our findings provide new insights into the predictors of incident excessive daytime sleepiness, but interventional studies are needed to understand the impact of treating these risk factors on the incidence of excessive daytime sleepiness. © 2020 European Sleep Research Society","determinants; drowsiness; epidemiology; hypoxic load; natural history; obstructive sleep apnea","Cohort Studies; Disorders of Excessive Somnolence; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Polysomnography; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; antidepressant agent; antidiabetic agent; antihypertensive agent; anxiolytic agent; hypnotic agent; neuroleptic agent; adult; age; aged; Article; coffee consumption; cohort analysis; controlled study; daytime somnolence; depression; diabetes mellitus; Epworth sleepiness scale; female; human; hypertension; incidence; major clinical study; male; periodic limb movement disorder; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; polysomnography; prevalence; priority journal; prospective study; psychopharmacotherapy; risk factor; sex difference; sleep disordered breathing; sleep quality; sleep time; middle aged; procedures; risk factor; somnolence","Alberti K.G., Eckel R.H., Grundy S.M., Zimmet P.Z., Cleeman J.I., Donato K.A., Harmonizing the metabolic syndrome: A joint interim statement of the International Diabetes Federation Task Force on Epidemiology and Prevention; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; American Heart Association; World Heart Federation; International Atherosclerosis Society; and International Association for the Study of Obesity, Circulation, 120, 16, pp. 1640-1645, (2009); Allen R.P., Mignot E., Ripley B., Nishino S., Earley C.J., Increased CSF hypocretin-1 (orexin-A) in restless legs syndrome, Neurology, 59, 4, pp. 639-641, (2002); Azarbarzin A., Sands S.A., Stone K.L., Taranto-Montemurro L., Messineo L., Terrill P.I., Wellman A., The hypoxic burden of sleep apnoea predicts cardiovascular disease-related mortality: The Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study and the Sleep Heart Health Study, European Heart Journal, 40, 14, pp. 1149-1157, (2018); Barnett A.G., van der Pols J.C., Dobson A.J., Regression to the mean: What it is and how to deal with it, International Journal of Epidemiology, 34, 1, pp. 215-220, (2005); Berry R.B., Budhiraja R., Gottlieb D.J., Gozal D., Iber C., Kapur V.K., Rules for scoring respiratory events in sleep: update of the 2007 AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events.

Previous work demonstrated that sympathetic activations during sleep typically accompany the occurrence of pathological respiratory and motor events, and their alteration may be associated with the arising of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Importantly, PWA-drops often occur in the absence of visually identifiable cortical micro-arousals and may thus represent a more accurate marker of sleep disruption/fragmentation. In this light, an objective and reproducible quantification and characterization of sleep-related PWA-drops may offer a valuable, non-invasive approach for the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of patients with sleep disorders. However, the manual identification of PWA-drops represents a time-consuming practice potentially associated with high intra/inter-scorer variability. Since validated algorithms are not readily available for research and clinical purposes, here we present a novel automated approach to detect and characterize significant drops in the PWA-signal. The algorithm was tested against expert human scorers who visually inspected corresponding PPG-recordings. Results demonstrated that the algorithm reliably detects PWA-drops and is able to characterize them in terms of parameters with a potential physiological and clinical relevance, including timing, amplitude, duration and slopes. The method is completely user-independent, processes all-night PSG-data, automatically dealing with potential artefacts, sensor loss/displacements, and stage-dependent variability in PWA-time-series. Such characteristics make this method a valuable candidate for the comparative investigation of large clinical datasets, to gain a better insight into the reciprocal links between sympathetic activity, sleep-related alterations, and metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Autonomic nervous system;

During this work, a new automatic tool was developed, aimed at a complete description of REMs activity during the night, both in terms of their timing of occurrence that in term of their directional properties. A classification stage of each singular movement detected during the night according to its main direction, was in fact added to our procedure of REMs detection and ocular artifact removal. A supervised classifier was constructed, using as training and validation set EOG data recorded during voluntary saccades of five healthy volunteers.

Animal research indicates that slow waves may involve complex interactions within and between cortical and subcortical structures. Conventional EEG in humans, however, has a low spatial resolution and is unable to accurately describe changes in the activity of subcortical and deep cortical structures. To overcome these limitations, here we took advantage of simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings to map cortical and subcortical hemodynamic (BOLD) fluctuations time-locked to slow waves of light sleep. Recordings were performed in twenty healthy adults during an afternoon nap. Slow waves were associated with BOLD-signal increases in the posterior brainstem and in portions of thalamus and cerebellum characterized by preferential functional connectivity with limbic and somatomotor areas, respectively. At the cortical level, significant BOLD-signal decreases were instead found in several areas, including insula and somatomotor cortex. Specifically, a slow signal increase preceded slow-wave onset and was followed by a delayed, stronger signal decrease. Similar hemodynamic changes were found to occur at different delays across most cortical brain areas, mirroring the propagation of electrophysiological slow waves, from centro-frontal to inferior temporo-occipital cortices. Finally, we found that the amplitude of electrophysiological slow waves was positively related to the magnitude and inversely related to the delay of cortical and subcortical BOLD-signal changes. These regional patterns of brain activity are consistent with theoretical accounts of the functions of sleep slow waves. © 2021","Cerebellum; EEG; fMRI; NREM; Slow wave; Thalamus","Adult; Brain Stem; Brain Waves; Cerebellum; Electroencephalography; Female; Functional Neuroimaging; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neurovascular Coupling; Sensorimotor Cortex; Sleep, Slow-Wave; Thalamus; adult; article; BOLD signal; brain stem; cerebellum; clinical article; electroencephalogram; female; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; hemodynamics; human; human experiment; insula; male; occipital cortex; stage 2 sleep; thalamus; theoretical study; cerebellum; diagnostic imaging; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography; functional neuroimaging; neurovascular coupling; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; sensorimotor cortex; thalamus","Allen P.J., Josephs O., Turner R., A method for removing imaging artifact from continuous EEG recorded during functional MRI, Neuroimage, 12, pp. 230-239, (2000); Amzica F., Steriade M., Short- and long-range neuronal synchronization of the slow (<1Hz) cortical oscillation, J.

At the same time, REMs produce substantial distortions on the electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, which strongly affect the significance of normal REM sleep quantitative study. In this work a new procedure for a complete and automated analysis of REM sleep is proposed, which includes both a REMs detection algorithm and an ocular artifact removal system. The two steps, based respectively on Wavelet Transform and adaptive filtering, are fully integrated and their performance is evaluated using REM simulated signals. Thanks to the integration with the detection algorithm, the proposed artifact removal system shows an enhanced accuracy in the recovering of the true EEG signal, compared to a system based on the adaptive filtering only. Finally the artifact removal system is applied to physiological data and an estimation of the actual distortion induced by REMs on EEG signals is supplied. © 2013 IEEE.","","Adult; Algorithms; Artifacts; Automation; Electroencephalography; Electrooculography; Eye Movements; Humans; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Sleep, REM; Time Factors; Young Adult; Adaptive filtering; Eye movements; Physiological models; Physiology; Signal detection; Automated analysis; Clinical parameters; Detection algorithm; Electroencephalographic signals; Physiological data; Prominent features; Quantitative study; Rapid eye movement; adult; algorithm; artifact; automation; electroencephalography; electrooculography; eye movement; human; physiology; REM sleep; signal processing; time; young adult; Sleep research","Buysse D.J., Hall M., Begley A., Cherry C.R., Houck P.R., Land S., Ombao H., Kupfer D.J., Frank E., Sleep and treatment response in depression: New findings using power spectral analysis, Psychiatry Res., 103, pp. 51-67, (2001); Menicucci D., Piarulli A., Debarnot U., D'Ascanio P., Landi A., Gemignani A., Functional structure of spontaneous sleep slow oscillation activity in humans, PLOS ONE, 4, (2009); Piarulli A., Menicucci D., Gemignani A., Olcese U., D'Ascanio P., Pingitore A., Bedini R., Landi A.A., Likeness-Based Detection of Sleep Slow Oscillations in Normal and Altered Sleep Conditions: Application on Low-Density EEG Recordings, IEE Trans Biomed Eng., 57, pp. 363-372, (2010); Petit D., Gagnon J.-F., Fantini M.L., Ferini-Strambi L., Montplaisir J., Sleep and quantitative eeg in neurodegenerative disorders, J Psychosom Res, 56, pp. 487-496, (2004); Artoni F., Chisari C., Menicucci D., Fanciullacci C., Micera S., EEG artifacts removal methods during Lokomat lower-limb rehabilitation,  IEEE RAS and EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics, pp. 902-997, (2012); He P., Wilson G., Russell C., Removal of ocular artifacts from electro-encephalogram by adaptive filtering, Med Biol Eng Comp, 42, pp. 407-412, (2004)","2-s2.0-84886564187"

Here, we investigated whether the FC-metrics weighted Phase Lag Index (wPLI) and weighted Symbolic Mutual Information (wSMI) may unveil functional differences across four stages of vigilance - wakefulness (W), NREM-N2, NREM-N3, and REM sleep - with respect to each other and to power-based features. Moreover, we explored their possible contribution in identifying differences between stages characterized by distinct levels of consciousness (REM+W vs. N2+N3) or sensory disconnection (REM vs. W). Overnight sleep and resting-state wakefulness recordings from 24 healthy participants (27 ± 6 years, 13F) were analyzed to extract power and FC-based features in six classical frequency bands. Cross-validated linear discriminant analyses (LDA) were applied to investigate the ability of extracted features to discriminate (1) the four vigilance stages, (2) W+REM vs. N2+N3, and (3) W vs. REM. For the four-way vigilance stages classification, combining features based on power and both connectivity metrics significantly increased accuracy relative to considering only power, wPLI, or wSMI features. Delta-power and connectivity (0.5-4 Hz) represented the most relevant features for all the tested classifications, in line with a possible involvement of slow waves in consciousness and sensory disconnection. Sigma-FC, but not sigma-power (12-16 Hz), was found to strongly contribute to the differentiation between states characterized by higher (W+REM) and lower (N2+N3) probabilities of conscious experiences. Finally, alpha-FC resulted as the most relevant FC-feature for distinguishing among wakefulness and REM sleep and may thus reflect the level of disconnection from the external environment.  © 2020 Sleep Research Society.","classification;

Methods: Cross-sectional study of HypnoLaus cohort, in which 2162 individuals underwent clinical assessment and in-home full polysomnography. PWA-drops were derived from photoplethysmography and processed using a validated automated algorithm. Associations between PWA-drop features (index, mean duration, and mean area under the curve [AUC]) with hypertension, diabetes, and previous cardiovascular (CV) event were analyzed using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression. Results: Two thousand one hundred forty-nine participants (59 ± 11 years, 51% women, 9.9% diabetes, 41.3% hypertension, 4.4% CV event) were included. Mean ± standard deviation (SD) of PWA-drop index, duration, and AUC during sleep were 51.0 ± 20.3 events/hour, 14.0 ± 2.7 seconds, and 527±115 %seconds, respectively. PWA-drop index was lower in women and decreased with age, while its mean duration and AUC increased in men and elderly. Overall, lower PWA-drop index, longer duration and greater AUC were associated with increased odds of hypertension, diabetes, or CV event after adjustment for confounders. Participants in the lowest quartile of mean duration-normalized PWA-drop index had a significantly higher odds ratio (OR) of hypertension (OR = 1.60 [1.19–2.16]), CV event (OR = 3.26 [1.33–8.03]), and diabetes (OR = 1.71 [1.06–2.76]) compared to those in the highest quartile. Similar results were observed for mean AUC-normalized PWA-drop index regarding hypertension (OR = 1.59 [1.19–2.13]), CV event (OR = 2.45 [1.14–5.26]) and diabetes (OR = 1.76 [1.10–2.83]). Conclusions: PWA-drop features during sleep seem to be an interesting biomarker independently associated with cardiometabolic outcomes in the general population. © Sleep Research Society 2020.","Autonomic nervous system; Biomarkers; Cardiovascular medicine; Diabetes; Epidemiology; Hypertension","Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Polysomnography; Sleep; Sleep Apnea Syndromes; alpha adrenergic receptor blocking agent; antidepressant agent; antihypertensive agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; adult; age; aged; algorithm; antihypertensive therapy; arterial stiffness parameters; Article; cardiometabolic risk; cardiovascular disease; clinical assessment; clinical outcome; confounding variable; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; disease association; Epworth sleepiness scale; exploratory research; female; frequency; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; photoelectric plethysmography; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; polysomnography; priority journal; pulse wave; pulse wave amplitude; sex difference; sleep; heart rate; sleep disordered breathing","Babchenko A, Et al., Photoplethysmographic measurement of changes in total and pulsatile tissue blood volume, following sympathetic blockade, Physiol Meas, 22, 2, pp. 389-396, (2001); Alian AA, Et al., Photoplethysmography, Best Pract Res Clin Anaesthesiol, 28, 4, pp. 395-406, (2014); Colombo R, Et al., Pulse photoplethysmographic analysis estimates the sympathetic activity directed to heart and vessels, Anesthesiology, 123, 2, pp. 336-345, (2015); Grote L, Et al., Finger plethysmography–a method for monitoring finger blood flow during sleep disordered breathing, Respir Physiol Neurobiol, 136, 2-3, pp. 141-152, (2003); Mihaljevic S, Et al., Area under the curve of finger photoplethysmography as an evaluation measure for sympathetic activity during lumbar epidural anaesthesia, Turk J Anaesthesiol Reanim, 46, 2, pp. 147-150, (2018); Vat S, Et al., Scoring criteria for portable monitor recordings: a comparison of four hypopnoea definitions in a population-based cohort, Thorax, 70, 11, pp. 1047-1053, (2015); Bosi M, Et al., Arousal responses to respiratory events during sleep: the role of pulse wave amplitude, J Sleep Res, 27, 2, pp. 259-267, (2018); Karmakar C, Et al., Detection of respiratory arousals using photoplethysmography (PPG) signal in sleep apnea patients, IEEE J Biomed Health Inform, 18, 3, pp. 1065-1073, (2014); Haba-Rubio J, Et al., Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome: effect of respiratory events and arousal on pulse wave amplitude measured by photoplethysmography in NREM sleep, Sleep Breath, 9, 2, pp. 73-81, (2005); Delessert A, Et al., Pulse wave amplitude drops during sleep are reliable surrogate markers of changes in cortical activity, Sleep, 33, 12, pp. 1687-1692, (2010); Zacharia A, Et al., Sleep apnea syndrome: improved detection of respiratory events and cortical arousals using oxymetry pulse wave amplitude during polysomnography, Sleep Breath, 12, 1, pp. 33-38, (2008); Adler D, Et al., Pulse wave amplitude reduction: a surrogate marker of micro-arousals associated with respiratory events occurring under non-invasive ventilation?, Respir Med, 107, 12, pp. 2053-2060, (2013); Heinzer R, Et al., Prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing in the general population: the HypnoLaus study, Lancet Respir Med, 3, 4, pp. 310-318, (2015); Firmann M, Et al., The CoLaus study: a population-based study to investigate the epidemiology and genetic determinants of cardiovascular risk factors and metabolic syndrome, BMC Cardiovasc Disord, 8, (2008); Preisig M, Et al., The PsyCoLaus study: methodology and characteristics of the sample of a population-based survey on psychiatric disorders and their association with genetic and cardiovascular risk factors, BMC Psychiatry, 9, (2009); Johns MW., A new method for measuring daytime sleepiness: the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Sleep, 14, 6, pp. 540-545, (1991); Buysse DJ, Et al., The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: a new instrument for psychiatric practice and research, Psychiatry Res, 28, 2, pp. 193-213, (1989); El Assaad MA, Et al., Validation of the Omron HEM-907 device for blood pressure measurement, Blood Press Monit, 7, 4, pp. 237-241, (2002); Weber MA, Et al., Clinical practice guidelines for the management of hypertension in the community: a statement by the American Society of Hypertension and the International Society of Hypertension, J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich), 16, 1, pp. 14-26, (2014); Iber C, Et al., The AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep andAssociated Events: Rules Terminology and Technical Specifications, (2007); Berry RB, Et al., Rules for scoring respiratory events in sleep: update of the 2007 AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events.

Here, we investigated the presence and cortical distribution of negative delta (1- 4 Hz) waves in human REM sleep by analyzing high-density EEG sleep recordings obtained in 28 healthy subjects. We identified two clusters of delta waves with distinctive properties: (1) a frontal-central cluster characterized by ~2.5-3.0 Hz, relatively large, notched delta waves (so-called “sawtooth waves”) that tended to occur in bursts, were associated with increased gamma activity and rapid eye movements (EMs), and upon source modeling displayed an occipital-temporal and a frontal-central component and (2) a medialoccipital cluster characterized by more isolated, slower (<2 Hz), and smaller waves that were not associated with rapid EMs, displayed a negative correlation with gamma activity, and were also found inNREMsleep. Therefore, delta waves are an integral part ofREMsleep in humans and the two identified subtypes (sawtooth and medial-occipital slow waves) may reflect distinct generation mechanisms and functional roles. Sawtooth waves, which are exclusive to REM sleep, share many characteristics with ponto-geniculo-occipital waves described in animals and may represent the human equivalent or a closely related event, whereas medial-occipital slow waves appear similar to NREM sleep slow waves. © 2019 the authors.","Hd-EEG;

As reactivation occurs when cell-mediated immunity (CMI) declines, and there is evidence that re-exposure to VZV boosts CMI, mass varicella immunization might increase the zoster burden, at least for some decades. Fear of this natural zoster boom is the main reason for the paralysis of varicella immunization in Europe. We apply optimal control to a realistically parametrized age-structured model for VZV transmission and reactivation to investigate whether feasible varicella immunization paths that are optimal in controlling both varicella and zoster exist. We analyse the optimality system numerically focusing on the role of the cost functional, of the relative zoster–varicella cost and of the planning horizon length. We show that optimal programmes will mostly be unfeasible for public health owing to their complex temporal profiles. This complexity is the consequence of the intrinsically antagonistic nature of varicella immunization programmes when aiming to control both varicella and zoster. However, we show that gradually increasing—hence feasible—vaccination schedules can perform better than routine programmes with constant vaccine uptake. Finally,we showthe optimal profiles of feasible programmes targeting mitigation of the post-immunization natural zoster boom with priority. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

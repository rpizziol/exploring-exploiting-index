# Exploring and Exploiting Behavior in Research Career Trajectories: Developing a Niche Index for Single Researchers

The landscape of scientific research is shaped by the dual forces of exploitation — deepening knowledge within established domains — and exploration — venturing into novel areas. Traditional metrics such as citation counts fail to capture the nuanced interplay of these behaviors. This proposal introduces a novel Niche Index, designed to quantify researchers' tendencies towards exploitation or exploration, thereby offering a multidimensional view of scientific contributions.

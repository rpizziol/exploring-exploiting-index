10.3390/brainsci13050755,0,"Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is deliberate harm to the body surface without suicidal intent, though it may be a predictor of suicide attempts. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that persisting and recovering NSSI may have a different longitudinal risk for suicidal ideation and behavior and that the intensity of Cyclothymic Hypersensitive Temperament (CHT) may increase this risk. Fifty-five patients (mean age 14.64 ± 1.77 years) referred for mood disorders according to the DSM-5 were consecutively recruited and followed-up for a mean of 19.79 ± 11.67 months and grouped according to the presence/absence of NSSI at baseline and follow-up into three groups: without NSSI (non-NSSI; n = 22), with NSSI recovered at follow-up (past-NSSI; n = 19), and with persistent NSSI at follow-up (pers-NSSI; n = 14). At follow-up, both NSSI groups were more severely impaired and failed to improve internalizing problems and dysregulation symptoms. Both NSSI groups reported higher scores in suicidal ideation compared to non-NSSI, but only pers-NSSI presented higher scores in suicidal behavior. CHT was higher in pers-NSSI, followed by past-NSSI and then by non-NSSI. Our data support a continuity between NSSI and suicidality, and they suggest the prognostic validity of persistent NSSI, associated with highest CHT scores.","Masi, Gabriele;Pisano, Simone;Sesso, Gianluca;Mazzullo, Cristina;Berloffa, Stefano;Fantozzi, Pamela;Narzisi, Antonio;Placini, Francesca;Valente, Elena;Viglione, Valentina;Milone, Annarita",7005105897;54397583800;57192830243;57220054864;21233331100;55891565300;43961521900;57219222551;57197758951;6506326296;7004113345
10.1080/14737175.2023.2271169,0,"Introduction: Conduct disorder (CD) is characterized by repetitive and persistent antisocial behaviors, being among the most frequently reported reasons of referral in youth. CD is a highly heterogeneous disorder, with possible specifiers defined according to age at onset, Limited Prosocial Emotions (LPE) otherwise known as Callous-Unemotional (CU) traits, Emotional Dysregulation (ED), and patterns of comorbidity, each with its own specific developmental trajectories. Areas covered: The authors review the evidence from published literature on the clinical presentations, diagnostic procedures, psychotherapeutic and psychoeducational approaches, and pharmacological interventions from RCT and naturalistic studies in youth. Evidence from studies including youths with LPE/CU traits, ED and aggression are also reviewed, as response moderators. Expert opinion: Due to its clinical heterogeneity, relevant subtypes of CD should be carefully characterized to gain reliable information on prognosis and treatments. Thus, disentangling this broad category in subtypes is crucial as a first step in diagnosis. Psychosocial interventions are the first option, possibly improving LPE/CU traits and ED, especially if implemented early during development. Instead, limited information, based on low-quality studies, supports pharmacological options. Second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and stimulants are first-line medications, according to different target symptoms, such as aggression and emotional reactivity. Developmental pathways including ADHD suggest a specific role of psychostimulants.","Masi, Gabriele;Carucci, Sara;Muratori, Pietro;Balia, Carla;Sesso, Gianluca;Milone, Annarita",7005105897;36660564800;36904806800;57193526944;57192830243;7004113345
10.1016/j.jaac.2023.01.017,0,"Objective: To systematically investigate if there is a significant association between markers of autonomic functioning and emotional dysregulation (ED) in children and adolescents. Method: Based on a preregistered protocol (PROSPERO: CRD42021239635), PubMed, Web of Knowledge/Science, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and APA PsycInfo databases were searched until April 21, 2021, to identify empirical studies reporting indices of autonomic nervous system (ANS) functioning in youths meeting DSM (version III, IV, IV-TR, 5 or 5-TR) or ICD (version 9 or 10) criteria for any psychopathological/neurodevelopmental condition and assessed for ED with a validated scale. Eligible outcomes included correlation coefficients between ED and ANS measures or differences in ANS measures between youths with and without ED. Study quality was assessed with the Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS) and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort studies. Random-effects meta-analyses were used for data synthesis. Results: There were 12 studies (1,016 participants) included in the descriptive review and 9 studies (567 participants) included in the meta-analyses. No evidence of a significant association between ED and altered cardiac or electrodermal functioning was found. However, exploratory meta-regressions suggested a possible association between reduced resting-state cardiac vagal control and increased ED. Conclusion: This study did not find evidence of an association between ED and autonomic dysfunction. However, preliminary evidence that reduced vagal control at rest might be a transdiagnostic marker of ED in young people was found. Additional studies comparing autonomic measures in youths with and without ED are needed and should also assess the effects of interventions for ED on ANS functioning.","Bellato, Alessio;Sesso, Gianluca;Milone, Annarita;Masi, Gabriele;Cortese, Samuele",57211907947;57192830243;7004113345;7005105897;57219708517
10.1080/17512433.2023.2181159,1,"Introduction: Antisocial personality disorder (AsPD) is a pervasive pattern of violation of others’ rights, related to the concept of psychopathy. AsPD is stable over time from adolescence, with evidence of conduct disorder (CD) before 15 years. DSM-5 included a specifier ‘with limited prosocial emotions’ (LPE), which characterizes adolescents with higher developmental vulnerability to develop AsPD. Despite being relatively frequent with considerable societal impact, AsPD is a difficult-to-treat condition with high comorbidity rates and poor evidence for effective pharmacological interventions. Areas covered: We conducted a narrative review and searched PubMed up to September 2022. We included RCTs and naturalistic studies evaluating pharmacological interventions on AsPD in adults, including those with comorbid substance use disorder or psychopathic traits. Evidence in youths with CD, callous-unemotional (CU) traits and aggression were also reviewed, exploring the role of CU traits as moderators of response. Expert opinion: Psychosocial interventions are the first option, with possible improvement of CU traits, beyond behavioral and affective symptoms, particularly if implemented early during development.

10.2174/1570159X20666220706104117,3,"Background: Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a highly comorbid condition, and rates of cooccurring disorders are even higher in youth. Comorbid disorders strongly affect clinical presentation, natural course, prognosis, and treatment. Methods: This review focuses on the clinical and treatment implications of the comorbidity between BD and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, disruptive behavior disorders (Oppositional Defiant Disorder and/or Conduct Disorder), alcohol and substance use disorders, Autism Spectrum Disorder, anxiety disorders, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and eating disorders. Results: These associations define specific conditions which are not simply a sum of different clinical pictures, but occur as distinct and complex combinations with specific developmental pathways over time and selective therapeutic requirements. Pharmacological treatments can improve these clinical pictures by addressing the comorbid conditions, though the same treatments may also worsen BD by inducing manic or depressive switches. Conclusion: The timely identification of BD comorbidities may have relevant clinical implications in terms of symptomatology, course, treatment and outcome. Specific studies addressing the pharmacological management of BD and comorbidities are still scarce, and information is particularly lacking in children and adolescents; for this reason, the present review also included studies conducted on adult samples. Developmentally-sensitive controlled clinical trials are thus warranted to improve the prognosis of these highly complex patients, requiring timely and finely personalized therapies.","Sesso, Gianluca;Brancati, Giulio Emilio;Masi, Gabriele",57192830243;57209070257;7005105897

10.1016/j.jad.2021.11.013,1,"Background: Cyclothymic-hypersensitive temperament (CHT) has been related to both depression and bipolarity, as well as to suicidality. Recently, a psychometrically sound way of assessment has been validated in youth (Cyclothymic-Hypersensitive Temperament Questionnaire, CHTQ), but data on clinical populations are still scant. Aim of our study is to further explore the structure and other psychometric properties of the revised version of CHTQ and its clinical implications in clinical samples. Methods: The study is based on a dataset of patients with unipolar depression, bipolar disorder and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (243 patients, 135 males, mean age 14.22 ± 2.16 years, age range 9–18 years), compared to a community sample of adolescents (398 subjects, 95 boys, mean age 15.47 ± 1.96 years, age range 10–18 years) Results: The two-correlated factor structure of CHT has been confirmed, with a moodiness/hypersensitiveness factor, correlated with internalizing symptoms, and an impulsiveness/emotional dysregulation factor, correlated with externalizing symptoms. All CHTQ scores correlate with global functioning. CHTQ total scores discriminate patients from healthy controls. Only CHTQ impulsiveness/emotional dysregulation subscale score is higher in bipolar patients, compared to unipolar depression and ADHD, whereas neither CHTQ moodiness/hypersensitiveness subscale score nor CHTQ total score discriminate between clinical groups. Limitation: Data on current mood states are unavailable. Patients were recruited in a third level clinic. The unipolar depression group is relatively small. Conclusion: CHT may be a rapid and reliable screening and diagnostic tool in the clinical practice with youth, exploring the cyclothymic dimension in different psychiatric disorders.","Pisano, Simone;Sesso, Gianluca;Senese, Vincenzo Paolo;Catone, Gennaro;Milone, Annarita;Masi, Gabriele",54397583800;57192830243;25628713200;54410200300;7004113345;7005105897

A total of 536 Italian students (47.76% male; 11–14 years) completed the PSCD, while their caregivers and teachers completed the SDQ. A series of confirmatory factor analyses to test the best fitting model were run. The internal consistency of the PSCD was evaluated, and the correlations between the PSCD self-reported scores and SDQ Parent and Teacher report scores were examined. A bi-factor model was fitted with a refined 19-item version of the scale, which showed adequate fit indices. The PSCD total score was strongly associated with higher parent-and teacher-rated conduct problems, hyperactivity, and lower prosocial behavioral symptoms. In conclusion, this study indicated that the self-report PSCD shows preliminary promise as a reliable, easy-to-use tool, for measuring psychopathic traits in Italian children and young adolescents.","Muratori, Pietro;Buonanno, Carlo;Gallani, Anna;Grossi, Giuseppe;Levantini, Valentina;Milone, Annarita;Pisano, Simone;Salekin, Randall T.;Sesso, Gianluca;Masi, Gabriele;Nocentini, Annalaura",36904806800;56954808200;54966555200;57300339000;57194113964;7004113345;54397583800;6603704360;57192830243;7005105897;35189276800
10.3390/brainsci11111399,6,"In recent years, there has been growing interest in investigating the effect of specific pharmacological treatments for ADHD not only on its core symptoms, but also on social skills in youths. This stands especially true for ADHD patients displaying impulsive aggressiveness and antisocial behaviors, being the comorbidity with Disruptive Behavior Disorders, one of the most frequently observed in clinical settings. This systematic review aimed to synthesize research findings on this topic following PRISMA guidelines and to identify gaps in current knowledge, future directions, and treatment implications. Search strategies included the following terms: ADHD; methylphenidate and other ADHD drugs; empathy, theory of mind and emotion recognition. Fulltext articles were retrieved and data from individual studies were collected. Thirteen studies were finally included in our systematic review. Ten studies assessing changes in empathy and/or theory of mind in patients with ADHD treated after pharmacological interventions were identified. Similarly, seven partially overlapping studies assessing changes in emotion recognition were retrieved. Despite a great heterogeneity in the methodological characteristics of the included studies, most of them reported an improvement in emphatic and theory of mind abilities in youths with ADHD treated with psychostimulants and nonstimulant drugs, as well as positive but less consistent results about emotion recognition performances.","Fantozzi, Pamela;Sesso, Gianluca;Muratori, Pietro;Milone, Annarita;Masi, Gabriele",55891565300;57192830243;36904806800;7004113345;7005105897
10.1016/j.seizure.2021.07.020,7,"Epilepsy is a common, often severe, feature of LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-RD) and could represent its onset and main manifestation, even in the absence of overt muscle involvement. To date, there is no systematic characterization of epilepsy in LAMA2-RD, and its impact on neurodevelopment and on the clinical course remains poorly established. In view of this knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic review of the literature and, as an illustrative example, reported the clinical case of a boy with late-onset LAMA2-related limb-girdle muscular dystrophy presenting with severe epilepsy. Our analyses of the literature data revealed a mean age at first seizure of 8 years, with significant differences between early- versus late-onset disease (5.78 ± 4.11 and 9.00 ± 2.65 years, respectively; p = 0.0007), and complete versus partial merosin deficiency (5.33 ± 3.70 and 10.36 ± 5.49 years, respectively; p = 0.0176). A generalized onset was the most common seizure presentation, regardless of merosin expression levels or the timing of muscular distrophy onset. Cortical malformations were not significantly associated with an earlier epilepsy onset, and were found to be quasi-significantly associated with a greater incidence of focal, or focal and generalized, onset seizures. No clear conclusions could be reached on the electrophysiological and neurodevelopmental features of the disorder, or on the relative efficacy of anti-epileptic treatments; further research on these aspects is needed. This systematic review helps to show that epilepsy in LAMA2-RD may be more than an ancillary manifestation of the disease, but rather one of its core features. A targeted and prompt electroencephalographic and epilepsy assessment, in addition to the specific neuromuscular workup, is therefore mandatory in early clinical management to pursue the best possible outcome for affected children.","Salvati, Andrea;Bonaventura, Eleonora;Sesso, Gianluca;Pasquariello, Rossella;Sicca, Federico",57220052073;57220053559;57192830243;56734512000;7801420531
10.1016/j.jad.2021.06.033,17,"Background: Increasing attention has been recently paid to precursors of bipolar disorder (BD). Symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been reported among the most common prodromes of BD. The aim of this study was to estimate the risk of BD in youths affected by ADHD based on prospective studies. Methods: A systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. A meta-analysis of single proportions was performed to compute the overall occurrence of BD in ADHD individuals. Binary outcome data were used to calculate risk estimates of BD occurrence in ADHD subjects versus Healthy Controls (HC). Results: An overall proportion of BD occurrence of 10.01% (95%-confidence interval [CI]: 6.47%-15.19%; I2 = 82.0%) was found among 1248 patients with ADHD over 10 prospective studies. A slightly higher proportion was found when excluding one study based on jack-knife sensitivity analysis (11.96%, 95%-CI: 9.15%-15.49%; I2 = 54.1%) and in three offspring studies (12.87%, 95%-CI: 8.91%-18.23%). BD occurrence was not significantly associated with mean follow-up duration (p-value = 0.2118). A greater risk of BD occurrence in ADHD versus HC from six studies was found (risk ratio: 8.97, 95%-CI: 4.26-18.87, p-value < 0.0001). Limitations: Few prospective studies have been retrieved in our search and most were not specifically aimed at assessing BD in followed-up ADHD patients.

10.3390/ijerph18157902,4,"The lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic has had adverse psychological effects on children and parents. While parenting is essential for positive development, increased parental distress has interfered with children’s wellbeing. In our study, we aimed to identify the predictors of parental distress in families of children with neuropsychiatric disorders during lockdown. Seventy-seven parents of children with neuropsychiatric disorders were asked to fill three online questionnaires (a socio-demographic questionnaire, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Parental-Stress-Index (PSI-4-SF) to explore the relationship between parental distress, emotional/behavioral problems in children and quarantine-related factors through univariate analyses and multiple mediation models. Significant positive associations between CBCL-internalizing-problems and all PSI-4-SF subscales, and between CBCL-externalizing-problems and “Difficult Child” subscales were found. “Parent– Child Dysfunctional Interaction” subscale and teachers–child relationship quality resulted negatively associated, as well as the “Difficult Child” subscale and peers–child relationship quality. The effect of teachers–child relationship quality on “Parent–Child Dysfunctional Interaction” was mediated by children internalizing problems, while the effect of peers–child relationship quality on “Difficult Child” by the child internalizing/externalizing problems. Internalizing problems in children with neuropsychiatric disorders were among the strongest predictors of parental stress during lockdown, mediating the indirect effects of quarantine-related factors, thus suggesting the importance of their detection during and after emergency situations to provide assistance and reduce parenting pressure.","Sesso, Gianluca;Bonaventura, Eleonora;Buchignani, Bianca;Vecchia, Stefania Della;Fedi, Caterina;Gazzillo, Marisa;Micomonaco, Jessica;Salvati, Andrea;Conti, Eugenia;Cioni, Giovanni;Muratori, Filippo;Masi, Gabriele;Milone, Annarita;Battini, Roberta",57192830243;57220053559;57212644397;57220050754;57220059496;57220059951;57220049791;57220052073;55935190900;7005561897;7005973250;7005105897;7004113345;7004015465

We developed and validated a novel self-report questionnaire for the assessment of ED, the RIPoSt-Y, both in clinical and non-clinical samples. Methods: Items selection and subscales construction were conducted on healthy controls (n=374), while test-retest reliability was evaluated in a subsample (n=72); internal consistency was examined both in the control group and in two clinical samples, respectively including patients with Bipolar Spectrum Disorders (BSD; n=44) and ADHD (n=34). Construct, concurrent and convergent validity were also assessed. Results: Thirty-one items were finally retained, and three subscales were identified (Affective Instability, Emotional Reactivity, Interpersonal Sensitivity). Test-retest was significant for each subscale with moderate-to-good correlations, and internal consistency showed good-to-excellent coefficients. Construct validity was supported by significant differences between patients and controls and gender-related differences. Concurrent validity was confirmed through significant associations with two subscales of the CHT-Q, while convergent validity proved to be significant with the CBCL/YSR dysregulation-profile. Cut-offs were also computed to discriminate clinically significant scores of ED. Limitations: The use of a school-based survey to recruit controls could have biased our results; gender distributions between clinical and non-clinical samples were significantly different.

10.1093/sleep/zsab006,13,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is commonly associated with sleep problems, possibly due to shared pathophysiology. Microstructural sleep electroencephalographic (EEG) alterations may likely represent markers of disordered cortical maturation in ADHD, although literature data are still conflicting, deserving further assessment. After having systematically reviewed the literature, we included 11 studies from 598 abstracts, and assessed 23 parameters of cyclic alternating pattern (CAP), four parameters of sleep EEG power and one parameter of sleep graphoelements through 29 meta-analyses and, when possible, univariate meta-regressions. Slow wave activity (SWA) in ADHD was significantly higher in early childhood and lower in late childhood/adolescence compared to controls, with an inversion point at 10 years. Total CAP rate and CAP A1 index in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stage 2 sleep, and CAP A1 rate in NREM sleep were significantly lower in ADHD patients than controls. SWA and CAP A1 changes are therefore possible markers of altered cortical maturation in ADHD, consistently with the neuropsychological deficits characterizing the disorder, likely fostering earlier detection of at-risk/milder conditions, and more tailored therapeutic interventions.","Biancardi, Carlo;Sesso, Gianluca;Masi, Gabriele;Faraguna, Ugo;Sicca, Federico",57226579401;57192830243;7005105897;14059853800;7801420531
10.3389/fpsyt.2021.619037,8,"Emotional dysregulation (ED) is currently the most frequently used term to describe children with an impaired regulation of emotional states. Recent research studies speculate whether ED may be a neurodevelopmental disorder itself, a shared risk factor, or a common key feature of several psychiatric disorders, including, among others, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and bipolar spectrum disorders (BSD). The association between ADHD and ED is one of the main reasons of misconceptions in the definition of boundaries between ADHD and BSD, leading to the frequent misdiagnosis of ADHD as BSD. Since ED is a multidimensional concept, a novel instrument—the Reactivity, Intensity, Polarity and Stability (RIPoSt) scale—was recently developed to assess the different dimensions of ED, which could help in detecting specific ED profiles in clinical youths. Our study included 154 patients, aged 13.8 ± 2.3 years, diagnosed with either ADHD, BSD, or comorbid condition, and a school-based sample of 40 healthy control (HC) adolescents, aged 12.5 ± 1.2 years. The RIPoSt scale and the Child Behavior Checklist were administered to both groups. Our results indicate that affective instability and negative emotionality subscales, as well as negative emotional dysregulation, are higher in BSD, both pure and comorbid with ADHD, while emotional impulsivity is higher in the comorbid condition and similar in the ADHD and BSD alone group; all clinical groups scored higher than HC. Conversely, positive emotionality is similar among clinical groups and within them and HC. Our findings also support the validity of the RIPoSt questionnaire, since the instrument proved to have good-to-excellent internal consistency, and strongly significant positive correlations were found with the CBCL-Dysregulation Profile, which is a commonly used, indirect measure of ED. Hence, the five subscales of the RIPoSt can be reliably used as an effective tool to study the emotional dysregulation in different clinical conditions, to help disentangle the complex relationship between ADHD and juvenile BSD and to provide clinicians with crucial evidence for better diagnostic characterization and therapeutic indications.","Masi, Gabriele;Sesso, Gianluca;Pfanner, Chiara;Valente, Elena;Molesti, Agnese;Placini, Francesca;Boldrini, Silvia;Loriaux, Nina;Drago, Flavia;Montesanto, Anna Rita;Pisano, Simone;Milone, Annarita",7005105897;57192830243;6602880097;57197758951;57223181036;57219222551;57220049612;57223179370;57209471811;57092244600;54397583800;7004113345

10.3390/jcm9123839,8,"Although childhood‐onset psychiatric disorders are often considered as distinct and separate from each other, they frequently co‐occur, with partial overlapping symptomatology. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) commonly co‐occur with each other and with other mental disorders, particularly disruptive behavior disorders, oppositional defiant disorder/conduct disorder (ODD/CD). Whether these associated comorbidities represent a spectrum of distinct clinical phenotypes is matter of research. The aim of our study was to describe the clinical phenotypes of youths with ADHD with and without ASD and/or ODD/CD, based on neuropsychological and psychopathological variables. One‐hundred fifty‐one participants with ADHD were prospectively recruited and assigned to four clinical groups, and assessed by means of parent‐reported questionnaires, the child behavior checklist and the behavior rating inventory of executive functions. The ADHD alone group presented a greater impairment in metacognitive executive functions, ADHD+ASD patients presented higher internalizing problems and deficits in Shifting tasks, and ADHD+ODD/CD subjects presented emotional‐behavioral dysregulation. Moreover, ADHD+ASD+ODD/CD individuals exhibited greater internalizing and externalizing problems, and specific neuropsychological impairments in the domains of emotional regulation. Our study supports the need to implement the evaluation of the psychopathological and neuropsychological functioning profiles, and to characterize specific endophenotypes for a finely customized establishment of treatment strategies.","Sesso, Gianluca;Cristofani, Chiara;Berloffa, Stefano;Cristofani, Paola;Fantozzi, Pamela;Inguaggiato, Emanuela;Narzisi, Antonio;Pfanner, Chiara;Ricci, Federica;Tacchi, Annalisa;Valente, Elena;Viglione, Valentina;Milone, Annarita;Masi, Gabriele",57192830243;57208302856;21233331100;54404575400;55891565300;56033320900;43961521900;6602880097;57209366467;57209367318;57197758951;6506326296;7004113345;7005105897
10.3390/brainsci10120918,49,"On 11 March 2020, a national lockdown was imposed by the Italian government to contain the spread of COVID19 disease. This is an observational longitudinal study conducted at Fondazione Stella Maris (FSM), Italy to investigate lockdown-related emotional and behavioural changes in paediatric neuropsychiatric population. Families having children (1.5–18 years) with neuropsychiatric disorders referred to FSM have been contacted and proposed to fulfil two online questionnaires (General questionnaire and Child Behaviour Check List (CBCL)) to (i) compare (paired two-sample t-tests) the CBCL scores during lockdown with previous ones, and (ii) investigate the influence (multiple linear regression models) of variables such as age, diagnosis grouping (neurological, neurodevelopmental, emotional, and behavioural disorders) and financial hardship. One hundred and forty-one parents fulfilled the questionnaires. Anxiety and somatic problems increased in 1.5–5 years subpopulation, while obsessive-compulsive, post-traumatic and thought problems increased in 6–18 years subpopulation. In the regression models, younger age in the 1.5–5 years subpopulation resulted as “protective” while financial hardship experienced by families during lockdown was related to psychiatric symptoms increasing in the 6–18 years subpopulation. Some considerations, based on first clinical impressions, are provided in text together with comments in relation to previous and emerging literature on the topic.","Conti, Eugenia;Sgandurra, Giuseppina;De Nicola, Giacomo;Biagioni, Tommaso;Boldrini, Silvia;Bonaventura, Eleonora;Buchignani, Bianca;Vecchia, Stefania Della;Falcone, Francesca;Fedi, Caterina;Gazzillo, Marisa;Marinella, Gemma;Mazzullo, Cristina;Micomonaco, Jessica;Pantalone, Gloria;Salvati, Andrea;Sesso, Gianluca;Simonelli, Valerio;Tolomei, Greta;Troiano, Irene;Cioni, Giovanni;Masi, Gabriele;Muratori, Filippo;Milone, Annarita;Battini, Roberta",55935190900;16025762200;57219741784;57220048874;57220049612;57220053559;57212644397;57220050754;58619226700;57220059496;57220059951;57220050572;57220054864;57220049791;57220057900;57220052073;57192830243;56942399400;57220055832;57220050348;7005561897;7005105897;7005973250;7004113345;7004015465
10.3390/brainsci10080489,9,"Executive functions have been previously shown to correlate with empathic attitudes and prosocial behaviors. People with higher levels of executive functions, as a whole, may better regulate their emotions and reduce perceived distress during the empathetic processes. Our goal was to explore the relationship between empathy and executive functioning in a sample of children and adolescents diagnosed with Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder alone or associated with comorbid Disruptive Behavior Disorders and/or Autism Spectrum Disorder. We also aimed to examine the role of empathic dimensions and executive skills in regulating externalizing behaviors. The 151 participants with ADHD were assigned to four groups according to their psychiatric comorbidity (either “pure” or with ASD and/or ODD/CD) and assessed by means of either parent-or self-reported questionnaires, namely the BRIEF−2, the BES, and the IRI. No questionnaire was found to discriminate between the four groups. Affective Empathy was found to positively correlate with Emotional and Behavioral Regulation competences. Furthermore, Aggressiveness and Oppositional Defiant Problems were positively associated with Executive Emotional and Behavioral Regulation competences. On the other hand, Rule-Breaking Behaviors and Conduct Problems were negatively associated with Affective Empathy and with Behavioral skills. Our study provides an additional contribution for a better understanding of the complex relationship between empathic competence and executive functions, showing that executive functioning and empathic attitudes interact with each other to regulate aggressive behaviors. This study further corroborates developmental models of empathy and their clinical implications, for which externalizing behaviors could be attenuated by enhancing executive functioning skills.","Cristofani, Chiara;Sesso, Gianluca;Cristofani, Paola;Fantozzi, Pamela;Inguaggiato, Emanuela;Muratori, Pietro;Narzisi, Antonio;Pfanner, Chiara;Pisano, Simone;Polidori, Lisa;Ruglioni, Laura;Valente, Elena;Masi, Gabriele;Milone, Annarita",57208302856;57192830243;54404575400;55891565300;56033320900;36904806800;43961521900;6602880097;54397583800;55693927100;8507556900;57197758951;7005105897;7004113345
10.3390/brainsci10080510,7,"Language deficits represent one of the most relevant factors that determine the clinical phenotype of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The main aim of the research was to study the grammatical comprehension of children with ASD. A sample of 70 well-diagnosed children (60 boys and 10 girls; aged 4.9–8 years) were prospectively recruited. The results showed that language comprehension is the most impaired language domain in ASD. These findings have important clinical implications, since the persistence of grammatical receptive deficits may have a negative impact on social, adaptive and learning achievements. As for the grammatical profiles, persistent difficulties were found during the school-age years in morphological and syntactic decoding in children with relatively preserved cognitive and expressive language skills. These data and the lack of a statistically significant correlation between the severity of ASD symptoms and language skills are in line with the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) perspective that considers the socio-communication disorder as a nuclear feature of ASD and the language disorder as a specifier of the diagnosis and not as a secondary symptom anymore. The presence of receptive difficulties in school-age ASD children with relatively preserved non-verbal cognitive abilities provides important hints to establish rehabilitative treatments.","Barsotti, Jessica;Mangani, Gloria;Nencioli, Roberta;Pfanner, Lucia;Tancredi, Raffaella;Cosenza, Angela;Sesso, Gianluca;Narzisi, Antonio;Muratori, Filippo;Cipriani, Paola;Chilosi, Anna Maria",57218375049;57218369736;6508230846;7801521900;22949336500;6602666986;57192830243;43961521900;7005973250;35290505100;6603317963
10.1016/j.clinph.2020.03.039,15,"Objective: The use of music-based neuro-stimulation for treating seizures and interictal epileptiform discharges (IED) (the so-called “Mozart effect”) remains a controversial issue. We have conducted an updated meta-analysis in order to systematically review literature evidence and provide further insights about the role of the Mozart effect in epilepsy. Methods: Following the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses” (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched three bibliographic databases from their date of inception to January 2020. Nine meta-analyses were performed according to both music stimulation protocols and outcome measures. We applied the Cochrane Q-test and the I2-index for heterogeneity evaluation, and either fixed-effect or random-effect models to compute mean differences and pool data. Results: Of 147 abstracts, 12 studies were included and grouped according to stimulation protocols and outcome measures. The nine meta-analyses showed significant reductions in seizures and IED frequencies after long-term music treatment, and in IED frequency during and after a single music stimulus. Conclusions: Music-based neurostimulation may improve the clinical outcome of individuals with epilepsy, by reducing the frequency of seizures and IED. Further and stronger evidence will allow defining its potential in the different forms of epilepsy, and the most effective stimulation protocols. Significance: Music therapy should be considered as a complementary, non-invasive approach for treating epilepsy and epileptiform discharges.","Sesso, Gianluca;Sicca, Federico",57192830243;7801420531
10.1093/sleep/zsz255,5,"Study Objectives: Recently, a role for gain-of-function (GoF) mutations of the astrocytic potassium channel Kir4.1 (KCNJ10 gene) has been proposed in subjects with Autism-Epilepsy phenotype (AEP). Epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are common and complexly related to sleep disorders. We tested whether well characterized mutations in KCNJ10 could result in specific sleep electrophysiological features, paving the way to the discovery of a potentially relevant biomarker for Kir4.1-related disorders. Methods: For this case-control study, we recruited seven children with ASD either comorbid or not with epilepsy and/or EEG paroxysmal abnormalities (AEP) carrying GoF mutations of KCNJ10 and seven children with similar phenotypes but wild-type for the same gene, comparing period-amplitude features of slow waves detected by fronto-central bipolar EEG derivations (F3-C3, F4-C4, and Fz-Cz) during daytime naps. Results: Children with Kir4.1 mutations displayed longer slow waves periods than controls, in Fz-Cz (mean period = 112,617 ms ?} SE = 0.465 in mutated versus mean period = 105,249 ms ?} SE = 0.375 in controls, p < 0.001). An analog result was found in F3-C3 (mean period = 125,706 ms ?} SE = 0.397 in mutated versus mean period = 120,872 ms ?} SE = 0.472 in controls, p < 0.001) and F4-C4 (mean period = 127,914 ms ?} SE = 0.557 in mutated versus mean period = 118,174 ms ?} SE = 0.442 in controls, p < 0.001). Conclusion: This preliminary finding suggests that period-amplitude slow wave features are modified in subjects carrying Kir4.1 GoF mutations. Potential clinical applications of this finding are discussed.","Cucchiara, Federico;Frumento, Paolo;Banfi, Tommaso;Sesso, Gianluca;Galante, Marco Di;D'Ascanio, Paola;Valvo, Giulia;Sicca, Federico;Faraguna, Ugo",58244250500;37118738200;57189336040;57192830243;57217050875;7004177059;55230015400;7801420531;14059853800
10.1016/j.sleep.2017.05.013,9,"Objective This preliminary study investigated electrophysiological and microstructural features of sleep in children and adolescents 4–18 years of age who were born to depressed mothers. Methods A total of 31 healthy subjects (15 male and 16 female) participated in the study. In this sample, 20 children born to mothers diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) were designated as “high-risk”; 11 children born to mothers without a personal history of depression were designated as “low-risk.” Polysomnography including three-channel electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded for one night at the Pediatric Sleep Unit of the University Hospital of Lyon, France. Clinical and demographic data were collected. Sleep architectural parameters were analyzed. Sleep microstructure was assessed with the scoring of cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) and CAP measures were calculated. Spectral analysis was performed, and mean EEG band power was computed for each sleep stage. Sleep electrophysiological features (slow waves and sleep spindles) were detected, and related parameters were analyzed. Data were compared between high- and low-risk groups using Student t tests. Results A reduction in low-frequency spindle activity and slow spindles spatio-temporal characteristics over frontal and central derivations, and an altered distribution of CAP phase A subtypes (reduction of A1 over A2–3 ratio) were observed in the high-risk group relative to the low-risk group. Conclusion Limited spindles generation and increased non-rapid eye movement sleep instability, observed in children born to depressed mothers, might reflect functional anomalies in cortical plasticity that could represent a pathogenic factor or an epiphenomenon for MDD.","Sesso, Gianluca;Bat-Pitault, Flora;Guyon, Aurore;Plancoulaine, Sabine;Banfi, Tommaso;Milioli, Giulia;Parrino, Liborio;Faraguna, Ugo;Franco, Patricia",57192830243;36987370900;54399868100;6603497428;57189336040;23767400600;7003591558;14059853800;55174516500
10.1016/j.sleep.2016.11.018,17,"Objective This study investigated sleep architecture in newborn and six-month-old infants who were born to depressed mothers. Method Sixty-four healthy full-term infants (32 males and 32 females) participated in the study. Of these, 32 were high-risk infants who were born to mothers diagnosed with depression, and 32 were low-risk infants born to mothers without a personal history of depression. 24-hour polysomnography was recorded at zero and six months of age (M0 and M6). Sleep macro-structural parameters (total sleep time, TST; awake time; non-rapid eye movement, NREM sleep (%); rapid eye movement, REM sleep %; arousal index; and sleep efficiency) were analysed at M0 and M6. Micro-architectural sleep features (slow-wave activity, SWA; delta sleep ratio, DSR; spindle density; and rapid eye movement density) were calculated at M6. The data between high-risk and low-risk groups were compared using Student's t-tests. Results At M0 and M6, the high-risk infants showed more awake time and fewer arousals than the low-risk infants. However, the high-risk group had less NREM% at M0 and a shorter TST as well as less REM% at M6 than the low-risk group. At M6, the high-risk group showed higher SWA, higher DSR and lower spindle density in comparison with the low-risk group. Conclusions Altered sleep structure was observed during their first months of life in infants born from depressed mothers, thereby suggesting that the prenatal environment could enhance the depression vulnerability of the child and potentially decrease their neuroplasticity.","Bat-Pitault, Flora;Sesso, Gianluca;Deruelle, Christine;Flori, Sophie;Porcher-Guinet, Véronique;Stagnara, Camille;Guyon, Aurore;Plancoulaine, Sabine;Adrien, Joëlle;Da Fonseca, David;Patural, Hugues;Franco, Patricia",36987370900;57192830243;6701389305;57189212968;57191976893;57191972229;54399868100;6603497428;7006765228;6603805585;6602632370;55174516500

10.1103/PhysRevE.108.054301,0,"At least two different approaches to define and solve statistical models for the analysis of economic systems exist: the typical, econometric one, interpreting the gravity model specification as the expected link weight of an arbitrary probability distribution, and the one rooted in statistical physics, constructing maximum-entropy distributions constrained to satisfy certain network properties. In a couple of recent companion papers, they have been successfully integrated within the framework induced by the constrained minimization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence: specifically, two broad classes of models have been devised, i.e., the integrated and conditional ones, defined by different, probabilistic rules to place links, load them with weights and turn them into proper, econometric prescriptions. Still, the recipes adopted by the two approaches to estimate the parameters entering into the definition of each model differ. In econometrics, a likelihood that decouples the binary and weighted parts of a model, treating a network as deterministic, is typically maximized; to restore its random character, two alternatives exist: either solving the likelihood maximization on each configuration of the ensemble and taking the average of the parameters afterwards or taking the average of the likelihood function and maximizing the latter one. The difference between these approaches lies in the order in which the operations of averaging and maximization are taken - a difference that is reminiscent of the quenched and annealed ways of averaging out the disorder in spin glasses. The results of the present contribution, devoted to comparing these recipes in the case of continuous, conditional network models, indicate that the annealed estimation recipe represents the best alternative to the deterministic one.","Di Vece, Marzio;Garlaschelli, Diego;Squartini, Tiziano",57845258900;6603265005;36912065800
10.1103/PhysRevResearch.5.043101,0,"Systems with lattice geometry can be renormalized exploiting their coordinates in metric space, which naturally define the coarse-grained nodes. By contrast, complex networks defy the usual techniques, due to their small-world character and lack of explicit geometric embedding. Current network renormalization approaches require strong assumptions (e.g., community structure, hyperbolicity, scale-free topology), thus remaining incompatible with generic graphs and ordinary lattices. Here we introduce a graph renormalization scheme valid for any hierarchy of heterogeneous coarse-grainings, thereby allowing for the definition of ""block-nodes""across multiple scales. This approach identifies a class of scale-invariant networks characterized by a necessary and specific dependence on additive hidden variables attached to nodes, plus optional dyadic factors. If the hidden variables are annealed, they lead to realistic scale-free networks with assortativity and finite local clustering, even in the sparse regime and in the absence of geometry. If they are quenched, they can guide the renormalization of real-world networks with node attributes and distance-dependence or communities. As an application, we derive an accurate multiscale model of the International Trade Network applicable across arbitrary geographic partitions. These results highlight a deep conceptual distinction between scale-free and scale-invariant networks, and they provide a geometry-free route to renormalization.","Garuccio, Elena;Lalli, Margherita;Garlaschelli, Diego",56912291700;57221149985;6603265005
10.1016/j.chaos.2023.113546,0,"The asymptotic (non)equivalence of canonical and microcanonical ensembles, describing systems with soft and hard constraints respectively, is a central concept in statistical physics. Traditionally, the breakdown of ensemble equivalence (EE) has been associated with nonvanishing relative canonical fluctuations of the constraints in the thermodynamic limit. Recently, it has been reformulated in terms of a nonvanishing relative entropy density between microcanonical and canonical probabilities. The earliest observations of EE violation required phase transitions or long-range interactions. More recent research on binary networks found that an extensive number of local constraints can also break EE, even in absence of phase transitions. Here we study for the first time ensemble nonequivalence in weighted networks with local constraints. Unlike their binary counterparts, these networks can undergo a form of Bose–Einstein condensation (BEC) producing a core–periphery structure where a finite fraction of the link weights concentrates in the core. This phenomenon creates a unique setting where local constraints coexist with a phase transition. We find surviving relative fluctuations only in the condensed phase, as in more traditional BEC settings. However, we also find a non-vanishing relative entropy density for all temperatures, signalling a breakdown of EE due to the presence of an extensive number of constraints, irrespective of BEC. Therefore, in presence of extensively many local constraints, vanishing relative fluctuations no longer guarantee EE.","Zhang, Qi;Garlaschelli, Diego",56416745900;6603265005
10.3390/e25050828,0,"Multilayer networks represent multiple types of connections between the same set of nodes. Clearly, a multilayer description of a system adds value only if the multiplex does not merely consist of independent layers. In real-world multiplexes, it is expected that the observed inter-layer overlap may result partly from spurious correlations arising from the heterogeneity of nodes, and partly from true inter-layer dependencies. It is therefore important to consider rigorous ways to disentangle these two effects. In this paper, we introduce an unbiased maximum entropy model of multiplexes with controllable intra-layer node degrees and controllable inter-layer overlap. The model can be mapped to a generalized Ising model, where the combination of node heterogeneity and inter-layer coupling leads to the possibility of local phase transitions. In particular, we find that node heterogeneity favors the splitting of critical points characterizing different pairs of nodes, leading to link-specific phase transitions that may, in turn, increase the overlap. By quantifying how the overlap can be increased by increasing either the intra-layer node heterogeneity (spurious correlation) or the strength of the inter-layer coupling (true correlation), the model allows us to disentangle the two effects. As an application, we show that the empirical overlap observed in the International Trade Multiplex genuinely requires a nonzero inter-layer coupling in its modeling, as it is not merely a spurious result of the correlation between node degrees across different layers.","Bayrakdar, Nedim;Gemmetto, Valerio;Garlaschelli, Diego",57219630216;56534251200;6603265005

10.1016/j.chaos.2022.112958,1,"In the study of economic networks, econometric approaches interpret the traditional Gravity Model specification as the expected link weight coming from a probability distribution whose functional form can be chosen arbitrarily, while statistical-physics approaches construct maximum-entropy distributions of weighted graphs, constrained to satisfy a given set of measurable network properties. In a recent, companion paper, we integrated the two approaches and applied them to the World Trade Web, i.e. the network of international trade among world countries. While the companion paper dealt only with discrete-valued link weights, the present paper extends the theoretical framework to continuous-valued link weights. In particular, we construct two broad classes of maximum-entropy models, namely the integrated and the conditional ones, defined by different criteria to derive and combine the probabilistic rules for placing links and loading them with weights. In the integrated models, both rules follow from a single, constrained optimization of the continuous Kullback–Leibler divergence; in the conditional models, the two rules are disentangled and the functional form of the weight distribution follows from a conditional, optimization procedure. After deriving the general functional form of the two classes, we turn each of them into a proper family of econometric models via a suitable identification of the econometric function relating the corresponding, expected link weights to macroeconomic factors. After testing the two classes of models on World Trade Web data, we discuss their strengths and weaknesses.","Di Vece, Marzio;Garlaschelli, Diego;Squartini, Tiziano",57845258900;6603265005;36912065800
10.1038/s41598-022-13996-3,3,"Recent crises have shown that the knowledge of the structure of input–output networks, at the firm level, is crucial when studying economic resilience from the microscopic point of view of firms that try to rewire their connections under supply and demand constraints. Unfortunately, empirical inter-firm network data are protected by confidentiality, hence rarely accessible. The available methods for network reconstruction from partial information treat all pairs of nodes as potentially interacting, thereby overestimating the rewiring capabilities of the system and the implied resilience. Here, we use two big data sets of transactions in the Netherlands to represent a large portion of the Dutch inter-firm network and document its properties. We, then, introduce a generalized maximum-entropy reconstruction method that preserves the production function of each firm in the data, i.e. the input and output flows of each node for each product type. We confirm that the new method becomes increasingly more reliable in reconstructing the empirical network as a finer product resolution is considered and can, therefore, be used as a realistic generative model of inter-firm networks with fine production constraints. Moreover, the likelihood of the model directly enumerates the number of alternative network configurations that leave each firm in its current production state, thereby estimating the reduction in the rewiring capability of the system implied by the observed input–output constraints.","Ialongo, Leonardo Niccolò;de Valk, Camille;Marchese, Emiliano;Jansen, Fabian;Zmarrou, Hicham;Squartini, Tiziano;Garlaschelli, Diego",57372953400;57372978700;57222183900;57372880300;22137270100;36912065800;6603265005

10.1111/2041-210X.13985,2,"Ecological networks such as plant–pollinator systems and food webs vary in space and time. This variability includes fluctuations in global properties such as the total number and intensity of interactions in the network but also in the number and intensity of local (i.e. node level) species interactions. Fluctuations of species' properties can significantly affect higher-order network features, for example, robustness and nestedness, and should therefore be taken into account in null models for pattern detection and hypothesis testing. In ecological research, classical null models treat node-level properties as ‘hard’ constraints that cannot fluctuate. Here, we review and synthesize a set of maximum-entropy methods that allow for fluctuating (‘soft’) constraints, offering a new addition to the classical toolkit of the ecologist. We illustrate the methods with some practical examples, pointing to currently available open-source computer codes. We clarify how this approach can be used by experimental ecologists to detect non-random patterns with null models that not only rewire, but also redistribute interaction strengths by allowing fluctuations in the enforced constraints. Explicit modelling of interspecific heterogeneity through local (i.e. species level) fluctuations of topological and quantitative constraints offers a statistically robust and expanded (e.g. including weighted links) set of tools to understand the assembly and resilience of ecological networks.","Caruso, Tancredi;Clemente, Giulio Virginio;Rillig, Matthias C.;Garlaschelli, Diego",7003382204;57605071400;7004185813;6603265005
10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.033105,2,"The World Trade Web (WTW) is the network of international trade relationships among world countries. Characterizing both the local link weights (observed trade volumes) and the global network structure (large-scale topology) of the WTW via a single model is still an open issue. While the traditional Gravity Model (GM) successfully replicates the observed trade volumes by employing macroeconomic properties such as GDP and geographic distance, it unfortunately predicts a fully connected network, returning a completely unrealistic topology of the WTW. To overcome this problem, two different classes of models have been introduced in econometrics and statistical physics. Econometric approaches interpret the traditional GM as the expected value of a probability distribution that can be chosen largely arbitrarily and tested against alternative distributions. Statistical physics approaches construct maximum-entropy probability distributions of (weighted) graphs from a chosen set of measurable, structural constraints and test distributions resulting from different constraints. Here we compare and integrate the two approaches by considering a class of maximum-entropy models that can incorporate macroeconomic properties used in standard econometric models. We find that the integrated approach achieves an overall better performance than the purely econometric one. These results suggest that the maximum-entropy construction can serve as a viable econometric framework wherein extensive and intensive margins can be separately controlled for, by combining topological constraints and dyadic macroeconomic variables.","Di Vece, Marzio;Garlaschelli, Diego;Squartini, Tiziano",57845258900;6603265005;36912065800
10.1088/1367-2630/ac5e89,3,"The asymptotic equivalence of canonical and microcanonical ensembles is a central concept in statistical physics, with important consequences for both theoretical research and practical applications. However, this property breaks down under certain circumstances. The most studied violation of ensemble equivalence requires phase transitions, in which case it has a 'restricted' (i.e. confined to a certain region in parameter space) but 'strong' (i.e. characterized by a difference between the entropies of the two ensembles that is of the same order as the entropies themselves) form. However, recent research on networks has shown that the presence of an extensive number of local constraints can lead to ensemble nonequivalence (EN) even in the absence of phase transitions. This occurs in a 'weak' (i.e. leading to a subleading entropy difference) but remarkably 'unrestricted' (i.e. valid in the entire parameter space) form. Here we look for more general manifestations of EN in arbitrary ensembles of matrices with given margins. These models have widespread applications in the study of spatially heterogeneous and/or temporally nonstationary systems, with consequences for the analysis of multivariate financial and neural time-series, multi-platform social activity, gene expression profiles and other big data. We confirm that EN appears in 'unrestricted' form throughout the entire parameter space due to the extensivity of local constraints. Surprisingly, at the same time it can also exhibit the 'strong' form. This novel, simultaneously 'strong and unrestricted' form of nonequivalence is very robust and imposes a principled choice of the ensemble. We calculate the proper mathematical quantities to be used in real-world applications.","Zhang, Qi;Garlaschelli, Diego",56416745900;6603265005
10.1002/ece3.8278,9,"Ecologists have long debated the properties that confer stability to complex, species-rich ecological networks. Species-level soil food webs are large and structured networks of central importance to ecosystem functioning. Here, we conducted an analysis of the stability properties of an up-to-date set of theoretical soil food web models that account both for realistic levels of species richness and the most recent views on the topological structure (who is connected to whom) of these food webs. The stability of the network was best explained by two factors: strong correlations between interaction strengths and the blocked, nonrandom trophic structure of the web. These two factors could stabilize our model food webs even at the high levels of species richness that are typically found in soil, and that would make random systems very unstable. Also, the stability of our soil food webs is well-approximated by the cascade model. This result suggests that stability could emerge from the hierarchical structure of the functional organization of the web. Our study shows that under the assumption of equilibrium and small perturbations, theoretical soil food webs possess a topological structure that allows them to be complex yet more locally stable than their random counterpart. In particular, results strongly support the general hypothesis that the stability of rich and complex soil food webs is mostly driven by correlations in interaction strength and the organization of the soil food web into functional groups. The implication is that in real-world food web, any force disrupting the functional structure and distribution pattern of interaction strengths (i.e., energy fluxes) of the soil food webs will destabilize the dynamics of the system, leading to species extinction and major changes in the relative abundances of species.","de Castro, Francisco;Adl, Sina M.;Allesina, Stefano;Bardgett, Richard D.;Bolger, Thomas;Dalzell, Johnathan J.;Emmerson, Mark;Fleming, Thomas;Garlaschelli, Diego;Grilli, Jacopo;Hannula, Silja Emilia;de Vries, Franciska;Lindo, Zoë;Maule, Aaron G.;Öpik, Maarja;Rillig, Matthias C.;Veresoglou, Stavros D.;Wall, Diana H.;Caruso, Tancredi",56608845100;6602669792;8574674400;7004543198;7005694382;26647423200;6701485176;56191826000;6603265005;54896428700;36489363500;7006711394;10840698100;7103188855;7801551463;7004185813;36451743200;7202196113;7003382204

10.1214/21-ECP432,2,"For random systems subject to a constraint, the microcanonical ensemble requires the constraint to be met by every realisation (‘hard constraint’), while the canonical ensemble requires the constraint to be met only on average (‘soft constraint’). It is known that for random graphs subject to topological constraints breaking of ensemble equivalence may occur when the size of the graph tends to infinity, signalled by a non-vanishing specific relative entropy of the two ensembles. We investigate to what extent breaking of ensemble equivalence is manifested through the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the graph. We consider two examples of constraints in the dense regime: (1) fix the degrees of the vertices (= the degree sequence); (2) fix the sum of the degrees of the vertices (= twice the number of edges). Example (1) imposes an extensive number of local constraints and is known to lead to breaking of ensemble equivalence. Example (2) imposes a single global constraint and is known to lead to ensemble equivalence. Our working hypothesis is that breaking of ensemble equivalence corresponds to a non-vanishing difference of the expected values of the largest eigenvalue under the two ensembles. We verify that, in the limit as the size of the graph tends to infinity, the difference between the expected values of the largest eigenvalue in the two ensembles does not vanish for (1) and vanishes for (2). A key tool in our analysis is a transfer method that uses relative entropy to determine whether probabilistic estimates can be carried over from the canonical ensemble to the microcanonical ensemble, and illustrates how breaking of ensemble equivalence may prevent this from being possible.","Dionigi, Pierfrancesco;Garlaschelli, Diego;Den Hollander, Frank;Mandjes, Michel",57221145184;6603265005;7003630220;7003783221
10.1080/14697688.2021.1890807,2,"One of the most challenging aspects in the analysis and modelling of financial markets, including Credit Default Swap (CDS) markets, is the presence of an emergent, intermediate level of structure standing in between the microscopic dynamics of individual financial entities and the macroscopic dynamics of the market as a whole. This elusive, mesoscopic level of organisation is often sought for via factor models that ultimately decompose the market according to geographic regions and economic industries. However, at a more general level, the presence of mesoscopic structure might be revealed in an entirely data-driven approach, looking for a modular and possibly hierarchical organisation of the empirical correlation matrix between financial time series. The crucial ingredient in such an approach is the definition of an appropriate null model for the correlation matrix. Recent research showed that community detection techniques developed for networks become intrinsically biased when applied to correlation matrices. For this reason, a method based on Random Matrix Theory has been developed, which identifies the optimal hierarchical decomposition of the system into internally correlated and mutually anti-correlated communities. Building upon this technique, here we resolve the mesoscopic structure of the CDS market and identify groups of issuers that cannot be traced back to standard industry/region taxonomies, thereby being inaccessible to standard factor models.

10.1038/s41598-020-76300-1,10,"Many real networks feature the property of nestedness, i.e. the neighbours of nodes with a few connections are hierarchically nested within the neighbours of nodes with more connections. Despite the abstract simplicity of this notion, various mathematical definitions of nestedness have been proposed, sometimes giving contrasting results. Moreover, there is an ongoing debate on the statistical significance of nestedness, since random networks where the number of connections (degree) of each node is fixed to its empirical value are typically as nested as real ones. By using only ergodic and unbiased null models, we propose a clarification that exploits the recent finding that random networks where the degrees are enforced as hard constraints (microcanonical ensembles) are thermodynamically different from random networks where the degrees are enforced as soft constraints (canonical ensembles). Indeed, alternative definitions of nestedness can be negatively correlated in the microcanonical one, while being positively correlated in the canonical one.

10.1088/1367-2630/ab74a7,11,"Due to the interconnectedness of financial entities, estimating certain key properties of a complex financial system, including the implied level of systemic risk, requires detailed information about the structure of the underlying network of dependencies. However, since data about financial linkages are typically subject to confidentiality, network reconstruction techniques become necessary to infer both the presence of connections and their intensity. Recently, several 'horse races' have been conducted to compare the performance of the available financial network reconstruction methods. These comparisons were based on arbitrarily chosen metrics of similarity between the real network and its reconstructed versions. Here we establish a generalized maximum-likelihood approach to rigorously define and compare weighted reconstruction methods. Our generalization uses the maximization of a certain conditional entropy to solve the problem represented by the fact that the density-dependent constraints required to reliably reconstruct the network are typically unobserved and, therefore, cannot enter directly, as sufficient statistics, in the likelihood function. The resulting approach admits as input any reconstruction method for the purely binary topology and, conditionally on the latter, exploits the available partial information to infer link weights. We find that the most reliable method is obtained by 'dressing' the best-performing binary method with an exponential distribution of link weights having a properly density-corrected and link-specific mean value and propose two safe (i.e. unbiased in the sense of maximum conditional entropy) variants of it. While the one named CReMA is perfectly general (as a particular case, it can place optimal weights on a network if the bare topology is known), the one named CReMB is recommended both in case of full uncertainty about the network topology and if the existence of some links is certain. In these cases, the CReMB is faster and reproduces empirical networks with highest generalized likelihood among the considered competing models.","Parisi, Federica;Squartini, Tiziano;Garlaschelli, Diego",57208624523;36912065800;6603265005
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006934,11,"Neural systems are organized in a modular way, serving multiple functionalities. This multiplicity requires that both positive (e.g. excitatory, phase-coherent) and negative (e.g. inhibi-tory, phase-opposing) interactions take place across brain modules.

Our method filters out both local (unit-specific) noise and global (system-wide) dependencies that typically obfuscate the presence of such structure. The method is guaranteed to identify an optimally contrasted functional ‘signature’, i.e. a partition into modules that are positively correlated internally and negatively correlated across. The method is purely data-driven, does not use any arbitrary threshold or network projection, and outputs only statistically significant structure.

10.1007/s10955-018-2208-5,6,"Synchronization of neurons forming a network with a hierarchical structure is essential for the brain to be able to function optimally. In this paper we study synchronization of phase oscillators on the most basic example of such a network, namely, the hierarchical lattice. Each site of the lattice carries an oscillator that is subject to noise. Pairs of oscillators interact with each other at a strength that depends on their hierarchical distance, modulated by a sequence of interaction parameters. We look at block averages of the oscillators on successive hierarchical scales, which we think of as block communities. In the limit as the number of oscillators per community tends to infinity, referred to as the hierarchical mean-field limit, we find a separation of time scales, i.e., each block community behaves like a single oscillator evolving on its own time scale. We argue that the evolution of the block communities is given by a renormalized mean-field noisy Kuramoto equation, with a synchronization level that depends on the hierarchical scale of the block community. We find three universality classes for the synchronization levels on successive hierarchical scales, characterized in terms of the sequence of interaction parameters. What makes our model specifically challenging is the non-linearity of the interaction between the oscillators. The main results of our paper therefore come in three parts: (I) a conjecture about the nature of the renormalisation transformation connecting successive hierarchical scales; (II) a truncation approximation that leads to a simplified renormalization transformation; (III) a rigorous analysis of the simplified renormalization transformation. We provide compelling arguments in support of (I) and (II), but a full verification remains an open problem.","Garlaschelli, D.;den Hollander, F.;Meylahn, J.

10.3389/fphy.2019.00055,28,"The structure of the International Trade Network (ITN), whose nodes and links represent world countries and their trade relations, respectively, affects key economic processes worldwide, including globalization, economic integration, industrial production, and the propagation of shocks and instabilities. Characterizing the ITN via a simple yet accurate model is an open problem. The traditional Gravity Model (GM) successfully reproduces the volume of trade between connected countries, using macroeconomic properties, such as GDP, geographic distance, and possibly other factors. However, it predicts a network with complete or homogeneous topology, thus failing to reproduce the highly heterogeneous structure of the ITN. On the other hand, recent maximum entropy network models successfully reproduce the complex topology of the ITN, but provide no information about trade volumes. Here we integrate these two currently incompatible approaches via the introduction of an Enhanced Gravity Model (EGM) of trade. The EGM is the simplest model combining the GM with the network approach within a maximum-entropy framework. Via a unified and principled mechanism that is transparent enough to be generalized to any economic network, the EGM provides a new econometric framework wherein trade probabilities and trade volumes can be separately controlled by any combination of dyadic and country-specific macroeconomic variables. The model successfully reproduces both the global topology and the local link weights of the ITN, parsimoniously reconciling the conflicting approaches.

On the theoretical side, this approach has unveiled a variety of physical phenomena, such as the emergence of mixed distributions and ensemble non-equivalence, that are observed in heterogeneous networks but not in homogeneous systems. At the same time, thanks to the deep connection between the principle of maximum entropy and information theory, statistical physics has led to the definition of null models for networks that reproduce features of real-world systems but that are otherwise as random as possible. We review here the statistical physics approach and the null models for complex networks, focusing in particular on analytical frameworks that reproduce local network features. We show how these models have been used to detect statistically significant structural patterns in real-world networks and to reconstruct the network structure in cases of incomplete information. We further survey the statistical physics models that reproduce more complex, semilocal network features using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, as well as models of generalized network structures, such as multiplex networks, interacting networks and simplicial complexes.","Cimini, Giulio;Squartini, Tiziano;Saracco, Fabio;Garlaschelli, Diego;Gabrielli, Andrea;Caldarelli, Guido",36781874700;36912065800;36344077800;6603265005;57222737548;55139905100

It is known that breaking of ensemble equivalence may occur when the size of the graph tends to infinity, signalled by a non-zero specific relative entropy of the two ensembles. In this paper we analyse a formula for the relative entropy of generic discrete random structures recently put forward by Squartini and Garlaschelli. We consider the case of a random graph with a given degree sequence (configuration model), and show that in the dense regime this formula correctly predicts that the specific relative entropy is determined by the scaling of the determinant of the matrix of canonical covariances of the constraints. The formula also correctly predicts that an extra correction term is required in the sparse regime and in the ultra-dense regime. We further show that the different expressions correspond to the degrees in the canonical ensemble being asymptotically Gaussian in the dense regime and asymptotically Poisson in the sparse regime (the latter confirms what we found in earlier work), and the dual degrees in the canonical ensemble being asymptotically Poisson in the ultra-dense regime. In general, we show that the degrees follow a multivariate version of the Poisson–Binomial distribution in the canonical ensemble.","Garlaschelli, Diego;den Hollander, Frank;Roccaverde, Andrea",6603265005;7003630220;57192299450
10.1088/1367-2630/aae566,5,"A quantitative understanding of societies requires useful combinations of empirical data and mathematical models. Models of cultural dynamics aim at explaining the emergence of culturally homogeneous groups through social influence. Traditionally, the initial cultural traits of individuals are chosen uniformly at random, the emphasis being on characterizing the model outcomes that are independent of these ('annealed') initial conditions. Here, motivated by an increasing interest in forecasting social behavior in the real world, we reverse the point of view and focus on the effect of specific ('quenched') initial conditions, including those obtained from real data, on the final cultural state. We study the predictability, rigorously defined in an information-theoretic sense, of the social content of the final cultural groups (i.e. who ends up in which group) from the knowledge of the initial cultural traits. We find that, as compared to random and shuffled initial conditions, the hierarchical ultrametric-like organization of empirical cultural states significantly increases the predictability of the final social content by largely confining cultural convergence within the lower levels of the hierarchy. Moreover, predictability correlates with the compatibility of short-term social coordination and long-term cultural diversity, a property that has been recently found to be strong and robust in empirical data. We also introduce a null model generating initial conditions that retain the ultrametric representation of real data. Using this ultrametric model, predictability is highly enhanced with respect to the random and shuffled cases, confirming the usefulness of the empirical hierarchical organization of culture for forecasting the outcome of social influence models. These results appear to be highly independent of the empirical data source.","Bǎbeanu, Alexandru Ionuţ;Vis, Jorinde Van De;Garlaschelli, Diego",54960941400;57204545687;6603265005

The need to compensate for the scarcity of data, while optimally employing the available information, has led to the birth of a research field known as network reconstruction.

A key step in the calculation of these quantities is the preliminary identification of statistically relevant country-product pairs.In this paper, we propose a method that could improve the current practice of filtering based on the revealed comparative advantage, by employing the maximum-entropy principle to construct an unbiased link weight probability distribution that, unlike the traditional thresholding method, allows for the statistical assessment of empirical trade volumes. The result is an adjusted geometric distribution for trade links that refines the revealed comparative advantage approach. This allows us to define the statistical significance of each trade link weight, leading to statistically supported trade link filtering decisions. Using this statistically justified filtering method, we have obtained results that are similar in nature to those that were found without this method, even though there are significant deviations in the details. In addition, the statistical information thus obtained on each trade link allows us to perform a spectral analysis of the export portfolio of individual economies.","Krantz, Ruben;Gemmetto, Valerio;Garlaschelli, Diego",57204466621;56534251200;6603265005

10.1155/2018/3615476,3,"Understanding the mechanisms underlying the formation of cultural traits is an open challenge. This is intimately connected to cultural dynamics, which has been the focus of a variety of quantitative models. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of connecting those models to empirically accessible snapshots of cultural dynamics. In particular, it has been suggested that empirical cultural states, which differ systematically from randomized counterparts, exhibit properties that are universally present. Hence, a question about the mechanism responsible for the observed patterns naturally arises. This study proposes a stochastic structural model for generating cultural states that retain those robust empirical properties. One ingredient of the model assumes that every individual's set of traits is partly dictated by one of several universal ""rationalities,"" informally postulated by several social science theories. The second, new ingredient assumes that, apart from a dominant rationality, each individual also has a certain exposure to the other rationalities. It is shown that both ingredients are required for reproducing the empirical regularities. This suggests that the effects of cultural dynamics in the real world can be described as an interplay of multiple, mixing rationalities, providing indirect evidence for the class of social science theories postulating such a mixing.","Bǎbeanu, Alexandru Ionu;Garlaschelli, Diego",54960941400;6603265005
10.1140/epjb/e2017-80337-7,5,"Understanding the dynamics of opinions, preferences and of culture as whole requires more use of empirical data than has been done so far. It is clear that an important role in driving this dynamics is played by social influence, which is the essential ingredient of many quantitative models. Such models require that all traits are fixed when specifying the “initial cultural state”. Typically, this initial state is randomly generated, from a uniform distribution over the set of possible combinations of traits. However, recent work has shown that the outcome of social influence dynamics strongly depends on the nature of the initial state. If the latter is sampled from empirical data instead of being generated in a uniformly random way, a higher level of cultural diversity is found after long-term dynamics, for the same level of propensity towards collective behavior in the short-term. Moreover, if the initial state is randomized by shuffling the empirical traits among people, the level of long-term cultural diversity is in-between those obtained for the empirical and uniformly random counterparts. The current study repeats the analysis for multiple empirical data sets, showing that the results are remarkably similar, although the matrix of correlations between cultural variables clearly differs across data sets. This points towards robust structural properties inherent in empirical cultural states, possibly due to universal laws governing the dynamics of culture in the real world. The results also suggest that this dynamics might be characterized by criticality and involve mechanisms beyond social influence.","Băbeanu, Alexandru Ionuţ;Talman, Leandros;Garlaschelli, Diego",54960941400;57199053731;6603265005
10.1007/s41109-017-0021-8,13,"Reconstructing weighted networks from partial information is necessary in many important circumstances, e.g. for a correct estimation of systemic risk. It has been shown that, in order to achieve an accurate reconstruction, it is crucial to reliably replicate the empirical degree sequence, which is however unknown in many realistic situations. More recently, it has been found that the knowledge of the degree sequence can be replaced by the knowledge of the strength sequence, which is typically accessible, complemented by that of the total number of links, thus considerably relaxing the observational requirements. Here we further relax these requirements and devise a procedure valid when even the the total number of links is unavailable. We assume that, apart from the heterogeneity induced by the degree sequence itself, the network is homogeneous, so that its (global) link density can be estimated by sampling subsets of nodes with representative density. We show that the best way of sampling nodes is the random selection scheme, any other procedure being biased towards unrealistically large, or small, link densities. We then introduce our core technique for reconstructing both the topology and the link weights of the unknown network in detail. When tested on real economic and financial data sets, our method achieves a remarkable accuracy and is very robust with respect to the sampled subsets, thus representing a reliable practical tool whenever the available topological information is restricted to small portions of nodes.","Squartini, Tiziano;Cimini, Giulio;Gabrielli, Andrea;Garlaschelli, Diego",36912065800;36781874700;57222737548;6603265005
10.1103/PhysRevE.96.032315,24,"Reconstructing patterns of interconnections from partial information is one of the most important issues in the statistical physics of complex networks. A paramount example is provided by financial networks. In fact, the spreading and amplification of financial distress in capital markets are strongly affected by the interconnections among financial institutions. Yet, while the aggregate balance sheets of institutions are publicly disclosed, information on single positions is mostly confidential and, as such, unavailable. Standard approaches to reconstruct the network of financial interconnection produce unrealistically dense topologies, leading to a biased estimation of systemic risk. Moreover, reconstruction techniques are generally designed for monopartite networks of bilateral exposures between financial institutions, thus failing in reproducing bipartite networks of security holdings (e.g., investment portfolios). Here we propose a reconstruction method based on constrained entropy maximization, tailored for bipartite financial networks. Such a procedure enhances the traditional capital-asset pricing model (CAPM) and allows us to reproduce the correct topology of the network. We test this enhanced CAPM (ECAPM) method on a dataset, collected by the European Central Bank, of detailed security holdings of European institutional sectors over a period of six years (2009-2015). Our approach outperforms the traditional CAPM and the recently proposed maximum-entropy CAPM both in reproducing the network topology and in estimating systemic risk due to fire sales spillovers.

Some practical applications such as community detection and centrality in economic networks have become main issues in this research area. Community detection algorithm for complex network analysis is mainly accomplished by the Louvain Method that seeks to find communities by heuristically finding a partitioning with maximal modularity. Traditionally, community detection applied for a network that has homogeneous semantics, for instance indicating friend relationship between people or import-export relationships between countries etc. However we increasingly deal with more complex network and also with so-called multiplex networks. In a multiplex network the set of nodes stays the same, while there are multiple sets of edges. In the analysis we would like to identify communities, but different edge sets give rise to different modularity optimizing partitions into communities. We propose to view community detection of such multilayer networks as a many-objective optimization problem. For this apply Evolutionary Many Objective Optimization and compute the Pareto fronts between different modularity layers. Then we group the objective functions into community in order to better understand the relationship and dependence between different layers (conflict, indifference, complementarily). As a case study, we compute the Pareto fronts for model problems and for economic data sets in order to show how to find the network modularity tradeoffs between different layers.","Maulana, Asep;Gemmetto, Valerio;Garlaschelli, Diego;Yevesyeva, Iryna;Emmerich, Michael",57188803967;56534251200;6603265005;57193707891;14033942100

Phys. 17 023052) it was shown that ensembles of random graphs are nonequivalent when the degrees of the nodes are constrained, in the sense of a non-zero limiting specific relative entropy as the number of nodes diverges. In that paper, the nodes were placed either on a single layer (uni-partite graphs) or on two layers (bi-partite graphs). In the present paper we consider an arbitrary number of intra-connected and inter-connected layers, thus allowing for modular graphs with a multi-partite, multiplex, time-varying, block-model or community structure. We give a full classification of ensemble equivalence in the sparse regime, proving that breakdown occurs as soon as the number of local constraints (i.e. the number of constrained degrees) is extensive in the number of nodes, irrespective of the layer structure. In addition, we derive an explicit formula for the specific relative entropy and provide an interpretation of this formula in terms of Poissonisation of the degrees.","Garlaschelli, Diego;Den Hollander, Frank;Roccaverde, Andrea",6603265005;7003630220;57192299450

While traditional macroeconomics has mainly used the gravity model to characterise the magnitude of trade volumes, modern network theory has predominantly focused on modelling the topology of the ITN. Combining these two complementary approaches is still an open problem. Here we review these approaches and emphasise the double role played by gross domestic product (GDP) in empirically determining both the existence and the volume of trade linkages. Moreover, we discuss a unified model that exploits these patterns and uses only the GDP as the relevant macroeconomic factor for reproducing both the topology and the link weights of the ITN.","Almog, Assaf;Squartini, Tiziano;Garlaschelli, Diego",14832317300;36912065800;6603265005

The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is known as the central circadian clock in mammals, but may also play an important role in adaptations to different photoperiods. The SCN receives direct light input from the retina and is able to encode day-length by approximating the waveform of the electrical activity rhythm to the duration of daylight. Changing the overall waveform requires a reorganization of the neuronal network within the SCN with a change in the degree of synchrony between the neurons; however, the underlying mechanisms are yet unknown. In the present study we used PER2::LUC bioluminescence imaging in cultured SCN slices to characterize network dynamics on the single-cell level and we aimed to provide evidence for a role of modulations in coupling strength in the photoperiodic-induced phase dispersal. Exposure to long photoperiod (LP) induced a larger distribution of peak times of the single-cell PER2::LUC rhythms in the anterior SCN, compared to short photoperiod. Interestingly, the cycle-to-cycle variability in single-cell period of PER2::LUC rhythms is also higher in the anterior SCN in LP, and is positively correlated with peak time dispersal. Applying a new, impartial community detection method on the time series data of the PER2::LUC rhythm revealed two clusters of cells with a specific spatial distribution, which we define as dorsolateral and ventromedial SCN. Post hoc analysis of rhythm characteristics of these clusters showed larger cycle-to-cycle single-cell period variability in the dorsolateral compared to the ventromedial cluster in the anterior SCN. We conclude that a change in coupling strength within the SCN network is a plausible explanation to the observed changes in single-cell period variability, which can contribute to the photoperiodinduced phase distribution.","Buijink, M.

10.1103/PhysRevE.94.042316,15,"Real-world multilayer networks feature nontrivial dependencies among links of different layers. Here we argue that if links are directed, then dependencies are twofold. Besides the ordinary tendency of links of different layers to align as the result of ""multiplexity,"" there is also a tendency to antialign as a result of what we call ""multireciprocity,"" i.e., the fact that links in one layer can be reciprocated by opposite links in a different layer. Multireciprocity generalizes the scalar definition of single-layer reciprocity to that of a square matrix involving all pairs of layers. We introduce multiplexity and multireciprocity matrices for both binary and weighted multiplexes and validate their statistical significance against maximum-entropy null models that filter out the effects of node heterogeneity. We then perform a detailed empirical analysis of the world trade multiplex (WTM), representing the import-export relationships between world countries in different commodities. We show that the WTM exhibits strong multiplexity and multireciprocity, an effect which is, however, largely encoded into the degree or strength sequences of individual layers. The residual effects are still significant and allow us to classify pairs of commodities according to their tendency to be traded together in the same direction and/or in opposite ones. We also find that the multireciprocity of the WTM is significantly lower than the usual reciprocity measured on the aggregate network. Moreover, layers with low (high) internal reciprocity are embedded within sets of layers with comparably low (high) mutual multireciprocity. This suggests that, in the WTM, reciprocity is inherent to groups of related commodities rather than to individual commodities.

Recent studies have shown that the binary projections of various financial and neural time series exhibit nontrivial dynamical features that resemble those of the original data. This implies that a significant piece of information is encoded into the binary projection (i.e. the sign) of such increments. Here, we explore whether the binary signatures of multiple time series can replicate the same complex community organization of the financial market, as the original weighted time series. We adopt a method that has been specifically designed to detect communities from cross-correlation matrices of time series data. Our analysis shows that the simpler binary representation leads to a community structure that is almost identical with that obtained using the full weighted representation. These results confirm that binary projections of financial time series contain significant structural information.","Almog, Assaf;Besamusca, Ferry;MacMahon, Mel;Garlaschelli, Diego",14832317300;56868581600;56732741300;6603265005

As a basis for predicting agents' choices we emphasize the connection between adaptive intelligent behavior, causal entropy maximization, and self-organized behavior in an open dynamic system. We cast this problem in the form of binary and weighted networks and suggest information theoretic entropy-driven methods to recover estimates of the unknown behavioral flow parameters. Our objective is to recover the unknown behavioral values across the ensemble analytically, without explicitly sampling the configuration space. In order to do so, we consider the Cressie-Read family of entropic functionals, enlarging the set of estimators commonly employed to make optimal use of the available information. More specifically, we explicitly work out two cases of particular interest: Shannon functional and the likelihood functional. We then employ them for the analysis of both univariate and bivariate data sets, comparing their accuracy in reproducing the observed trends.","Squartini, Tiziano;Ser-Giacomi, Enrico;Garlaschelli, Diego;Judge, George",36912065800;55199831700;6603265005;6701716155

Of particular interest is establishing whether a real economic network is in a state of (quasi)stationary equilibrium, i.e. characterized by smooth structural changes rather than abrupt transitions. While in the former case the behaviour of the system can be reasonably controlled and predicted, in the latter case this is generally impossible. Here, we propose a method to assess whether a real economic network is in a quasi-stationary state by checking the consistency of its structural evolution with appropriate quasi-equilibrium maximum-entropy ensembles of graphs. As illustrative examples, we consider the International Trade Network (ITN) and the Dutch Interbank Network (DIN). We find that the ITN is an almost perfect example of quasi-equilibrium network, while the DIN is clearly out-of-equilibrium. In the latter, the entity of the deviation from quasistationarity contains precious information that allows us to identify remarkable early warning signals of the interbank crisis of 2008. These early warning signals involve certain dyadic and triadic topological properties, including dangerous 'debt loops' with different levels of interbank reciprocity.","Squartini, Tiziano;Garlaschelli, Diego",36912065800;6603265005

An important requirement is that the sampling process is unbiased and efficient. The main approaches are microcanonical, i.e. they sample graphs that match the enforced constraints exactly. Unfortunately, when applied to strongly heterogeneous networks (like most real-world examples), the majority of these approaches become biased and/or time-consuming. Moreover, the algorithms defined in the simplest cases, such as binary graphs with given degrees, are not easily generalizable to more complicated ensembles. Here we propose a solution to the problem via the introduction of a 'Maximize and Sample' ('Max & Sam' for short) method to correctly sample ensembles of networks where the constraints are 'soft', i.e. realized as ensemble averages. Our method is based on exact maximum-entropy distributions and is therefore unbiased by construction, even for strongly heterogeneous networks. It is also more computationally efficient than most microcanonical alternatives. Finally, it works for both binary and weighted networks with a variety of constraints, including combined degree-strength sequences and full reciprocity structure, for which no alternative method exists. Our canonical approach can in principle be turned into an unbiased microcanonical one, via a restriction to the relevant subset. Importantly, the analysis of the fluctuations of the constraints suggests that the microcanonical and canonical versions of all the ensembles considered here are not equivalent.

10.1088/1367-2630/17/1/013009,27,"Recent events such as the global financial crisis have renewed the interest in the topic of economic networks. One of the main channels of shock propagation among countries is the International Trade Network (ITN). Two important models for the ITN structure, the classical gravity model of trade (more popular among economists) and the fitness model (more popular among networks scientists), are both limited to the characterization of only one representation of the ITN. The gravity model satisfactorily predicts the volume of trade between connected countries, but cannot reproduce the missing links (i.e. the topology). On the other hand, the fitness model can successfully replicate the topology of the ITN, but cannot predict the volumes. This paper tries to make an important step forward in the unification of those two frameworks, by proposing a new gross domestic product (GDP) driven model which can simultaneously reproduce the binary and the weighted properties of the ITN. Specifically, we adopt a maximum-entropy approach where both the degree and the strength of each node are preserved. We then identify strong nonlinear relationships between the GDP and the parameters of the model. This ultimately results in a weighted generalization of the fitness model of trade, where the GDP plays the role of a 'macroeconomic fitness' shaping the binary and the weighted structure of the ITN simultaneously. Our model mathematically explains an important asymmetry in the role of binary and weighted network properties, namely the fact that binary properties can be inferred without the knowledge of weighted ones, while the opposite is not true.","Almog, Assaf;Squartini, Tiziano;Garlaschelli, Diego",14832317300;36912065800;6603265005

A promising alternative is that of employing community detection techniques developed in network theory. Unfortunately, this approach has focused predominantly on replacing network data with correlation matrices, a procedure that we show to be intrinsically biased because of its inconsistency with the null hypotheses underlying the existing algorithms. Here, we introduce, via a consistent redefinition of null models based on random matrix theory, the appropriate correlation-based counterparts of the most popular community detection techniques. Our methods can filter out both unit-specific noise and systemwide dependencies, and the resulting communities are internally correlated and mutually anticorrelated. We also implement multiresolution and multifrequency approaches revealing hierarchically nested subcommunities with ""hard"" cores and ""soft"" peripheries.

Hence, the definition of proper mathematical quantities aiming at capturing the added level of complexity of those systems is required. Various steps in this direction have been made. In the simplest case, dependencies between layers are measured via correlation-based metrics, a procedure that we show to be equivalent to the use of completely homogeneous benchmarks specifying only global constraints. However, this approach does not take into account the heterogeneity in the degree and strength distributions, which is instead a fundamental feature of real-world multiplexes. In this work, we compare the observed dependencies between layers with the expected values obtained from maximum-entropy reference models that appropriately control for the observed heterogeneity in the degree and strength distributions. This information-theoretic approach results in the introduction of novel and improved multiplexity measures that we test on different datasets, i.e. the International Trade Network and the European Airport Network.

This method uses the knowledge of an intrinsic property of the nodes (indicated as fitness), and the number of connections of only a limited subset of nodes, in order to generate an ensemble of exponential random graphs that are representative of the real systems and that can be used to estimate its topological properties. Here we focus in particular on reconstructing the most basic properties that are commonly used to describe a network: density of links, assortativity, clustering.

However, several studies have proved that real economic networks and multiplexes topologically differ from configurations inferred only from node strengths. Here we provide a detailed analysis of the world trade multiplex by comparing it to an enhanced null model that simultaneously reproduces the strength and the degree of each node. We study several temporal snapshots and almost 100 layers (commodity classes) of the multiplex and find that the observed properties are systematically well reproduced by our model.

In this paper we provide further evidence of this by showing strong nonlinear relations between binary and non-binary properties of financial time series. These relations are a novel quantification of the fact that extreme price increments occur more often when most stocks move in the same direction. We then introduce an information-theoretic approach to the analysis of the binary signature of single and multiple time series. Through the definition of maximum-entropy ensembles of binary matrices and their mapping to spin models in statistical physics, we quantify the information encoded into the simplest binary properties of real time series and identify the most informative property given a set of measurements. Our formalism is able to accurately replicate, and mathematically characterize, the observed binary/non-binary relations. We also obtain a phase diagram allowing us to identify, based only on the instantaneous aggregate return of a set of multiple time series, a regime where the so-called 'market mode' has an optimal interpretation in terms of collective (endogenous) effects, a regime where it is parsimoniously explained by pure noise, and a regime where it can be regarded as a combination of endogenous and exogenous factors.

Whenever the whole structure of a network is unknown, one must resort to reconstruction methods that identify the least biased ensemble of networks consistent with the partial information available. A challenging case, frequently encountered due to privacy issues in the analysis of interbank flows and Big Data, is when there is only local (node-specific) aggregate information available. For binary networks, the relevant ensemble is one where the degree (number of links) of each node is constrained to its observed value. However, for weighted networks the problem is much more complicated. While the näve approach prescribes to constrain the strengths (total link weights) of all nodes, recent counter-intuitive results suggest that in weighted networks the degrees are often more informative than the strengths. This implies that the reconstruction of weighted networks would be significantly enhanced by the specification of both strengths and degrees, a computationally hard and bias-prone procedure. Here we solve this problem by introducing an analytical and unbiased maximum-entropy method that works in the shortest possible time and does not require the explicit generation of reconstructed samples. We consider several real-world examples and show that, while the strengths alone give poor results, the additional knowledge of the degrees yields accurately reconstructed networks. Information-theoretic criteria rigorously confirm that the degree sequence, as soon as it is non-trivial, is irreducible to the strength sequence.

Theoretical models suggest that short-term collective behavior and longterm cultural diversity are mutually excluding, since they require very different levels of social influence. The latter jointly depends on two factors: the topology of the underlying social network and the overlap between individuals in multidimensional cultural space. However, while the empirical properties of social networks are intensively studied, little is known about the large-scale organization of real societies in cultural space, so that random input specifications are necessarily used in models. Here we use a large dataset to perform a high-dimensional analysis of the scientific beliefs of thousands of Europeans. We find that interopinion correlations determine a nontrivial ultrametric hierarchy of individuals in cultural space. When empirical data are used as inputs in models, ultrametricity has strong and counterintuitive effects. On short timescales, it facilitates a symmetry-breaking phase transition triggering coordinated social behavior. On long timescales, it suppresses cultural convergence by restricting it within disjoint groups. Moreover, ultrametricity implies that these results are surprisingly robust to modifications of the dynamical rules considered. Thus the empirical distribution of individuals in cultural space appears to systematically optimize the coexistence of short-term collective behavior and long-term cultural diversity, which can be realized simultaneously for the same moderate level of mutual influence in a diverse range of online and offline settings.","Valori, Luca;Picciolo, Francesco;Allansdottir, Agnes;Garlaschelli, Diego",54935758100;53881839300;22946406900;6603265005

Therefore, understanding the WTN topological properties deviating from randomness provides direct empirical information about the structural effects of self-organization. Here, using an analytical pattern-detection method we have recently proposed, we study the occurrence of triadic ‘motifs’ (three-vertices subgraphs) in the WTN between 1950 and 2000. We find that motifs are not explained by only the in- and out-degree sequences, but they are completely explained if also the numbers of reciprocal edges are taken into account.

Approached here from a complex systems point of view, the network of energy supply might be represented by a graph in which nodes are Italian municipalities and edges cross the administrative boundaries from a municipality to its first neighbours. Using datasets from ISTAT, GSE and ENEA, the node production and attraction of photovoltaic energy have been estimated with high accuracy. The attraction index was built using demographic data, in accordance with medium per capita energy consumption data. Moreover, the energy produced in each node could be determined using data on the installed photovoltaic power and on local solar radiation. The available energy on each node was calculated by running a distributive model assuming that the energy produced in one node which diffuses to its first neighbours is proportional to the attraction index of the latter. Therefore the available energy at each node is the sum of many contributions, coming from topological paths involving all the other nodes across the network.

However, it is still unclear whether a network approach conveys additional, nontrivial information with respect to traditional international-economics analyses that describe world trade only in terms of local (first-order) properties. In this and in a companion paper, we employ a recently proposed randomization method to assess in detail the role that local properties have in shaping higher-order patterns of the ITN in all its possible representations (binary or weighted, directed or undirected, aggregated or disaggregated by commodity) and across several years. Here we show that, remarkably, the properties of all binary projections of the network can be completely traced back to the degree sequence, which is therefore maximally informative.

We propose the application of a modelling strategy based on the theoretical approach of Akaike's information criteria and non-linear model fitting (nlm). Accordingly, we collated and modelled available data at intraspecific level on the individual standard metabolic rate of Antarctic microarthropods as a function of body mass (M), temperature (T), species identity (S) and high rank taxa to which species belong (G) and tested predictions from metabolic scaling theory (mass-metabolism allometric exponent b = 0.75, activation energy range 0.2-1.2 eV). We also performed allometric analysis based on logarithmic transformations (lm). Conclusions from lm and nlm approaches were different. Best-supported models from lm incorporated T, M and S. The estimates of the allometric scaling exponent linking body mass and metabolic rate resulted in a value of 0.696 ± 0.105 (mean ± 95% CI). In contrast, the four best-supported nlm models suggested that both the scaling exponent and activation energy significantly vary across the high rank taxa (Collembola, Cryptostigmata, Mesostigmata and Prostigmata) to which species belong, with mean values of b ranging from about 0.6 to 0.8. We therefore reached two conclusions: 1, published analyses of arthropod metabolism based on logarithmic data may be biased by data transformation; 2, non-linear models applied to Antarctic microarthropod metabolic rate suggest that intraspecific scaling of standard metabolic rate in Antarctic microarthropods is highly variable and can be characterised by scaling exponents that greatly vary within taxa, which may have biased previous interspecific comparisons that neglected intraspecific variability. © 2009 The Authors.","Caruso, Tancredi;Garlaschelli, Diego;Bargagli, Roberto;Convey, Peter",7003382204;6603265005;7003264852;7003362070

Commodity-specific networks also display average connectivity, clustering, and centrality levels very different from their aggregate counterpart.

10.1038/s41598-023-46905-3,0,"Professional traders need to process a large amount of visual information in their daily activity to judge how risky it is to trade specific investment products. Despite some studies investigating the effects of display clutter on traders, visual attention and memory were never investigated in controlled experimental tasks in this population. Following a preliminary study with 30 participants, visual selective attention and visual working memory were measured and compared between two groups of 15 traders and 15 non-traders (salespeople, acting as a control group) from a large-scale banking group in three experimental tasks measuring selective attention in complex visual contexts, simulating display clutter situations (Visual search), cognitive interference (Stroop task), and a delayed recall visual working memory task. In the Visual search task, traders displayed faster response times (RTs) than non-traders for small display sets, while their performance overlapped for large sets. In the Stroop task, traders showed faster RTs than non-traders but were nevertheless affected by cognitive interference. The memory task highlighted no significant differences between the groups. Therefore, this study found an advantage in traders’ attention when processing visual information in small sets with no retention. This result could influence trading activity—determining an immediate use of relevant visual information in decision making—and traders’ display layout organization.","Bossi, Francesco;Malizia, Andrea P.;D’Arcangelo, Sonia;Maggi, Francesca;Lattanzi, Nicola;Ricciardi, Emiliano",56963595100;16028897900;57463509700;57232266500;56136055200;8565770200
10.1038/s41598-023-34998-9,0,"Narratives are paradigmatic examples of natural language, where nouns represent a proxy of information. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies revealed the recruitment of temporal cortices during noun processing and the existence of a noun-specific network at rest. Yet, it is unclear whether, in narratives, changes in noun density influence the brain functional connectivity, so that the coupling between regions correlates with information load. We acquired fMRI activity in healthy individuals listening to a narrative with noun density changing over time and measured whole-network and node-specific degree and betweenness centrality. Network measures were correlated with information magnitude with a time-varying approach. Noun density correlated positively with the across-regions average number of connections and negatively with the average betweenness centrality, suggesting the pruning of peripheral connections as information decreased. Locally, the degree of the bilateral anterior superior temporal sulcus (aSTS) was positively associated with nouns. Importantly, aSTS connectivity cannot be explained by changes in other parts of speech (e.g., verbs) or syllable density. Our results indicate that the brain recalibrates its global connectivity as a function of the information conveyed by nouns in natural language. Also, using naturalistic stimulation and network metrics, we corroborate the role of aSTS in noun processing.","Mastrandrea, Rossana;Cecchetti, Luca;Lettieri, Giada;Handjaras, Giacomo;Leo, Andrea;Papale, Paolo;Gili, Tommaso;Martini, Nicola;Latta, Daniele Della;Chiappino, Dante;Pietrini, Pietro;Ricciardi, Emiliano",56150284600;56625136900;56680972900;35748302500;55311312500;57190440455;13310221100;23025355600;6507141723;8446507300;7005057128;8565770200
10.1523/ENEURO.0026-23.2023,0,"The auditory system relies on both local and summary representations; acoustic local features exceeding system constraints are compacted into a set of summary statistics. Such compression is pivotal for sound-object recognition. Here, we assessed whether computations subtending local and statistical representations of sounds could be distinguished at the neural level. A computational auditory model was employed to extract auditory statistics from natural sound textures (i.e., fire, rain) and to generate synthetic exemplars where local and statistical properties were controlled. Twenty-four human participants were passively exposed to auditory streams while the electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Each stream could consist of short, medium, or long sounds to vary the amount of acoustic information. Short and long sounds were expected to engage local or summary statistics representations, respectively. Data revealed a clear dissociation. Compared with summary-based ones, auditory-evoked responses based on local information were selectively greater in magnitude in short sounds. Opposite patterns emerged for longer sounds. Neural oscillations revealed that local features and summary statistics rely on neural activity occurring at different temporal scales, faster (beta) or slower (theta-alpha). These dissociations emerged automatically without explicit engagement in a discrimination task. Overall, this study demonstrates that the auditory system developed distinct coding mechanisms to discriminate changes in the acoustic environment based on fine structure and summary representations.","Berto, Martina;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Pietrini, Pietro;Weisz, Nathan;Bottari, Davide",57193672967;8565770200;7005057128;6602346810;24365931900

The Beck Cognitive Insight Scale was developed to assess cognitive insight and includes two subscales, Self-Reflectiveness and Self-Certainty (SC). The present study aimed to investigate the underlying factor structure of the Italian version of the BCIS in patients with schizophrenia (SZ) and in the general population (GP) for the first time. A cross-sectional design was adopted and a GP sample of 624 subjects and an SZ sample of 130 patients were enrolled. In the SZ group, a two-factor solution was supported. The internal reliability of each factor was satisfactory. Two items were eliminated and one item moved from the SC to the SR subscale. In the GP group, a two-factor solution was highlighted. The internal reliability of each factor was satisfactory. However, four items of the SR subscale were deleted. The Italian-validated version of the BCIS shows different structures for the SZ and the GP and is characterized by different features concerning previous studies.

Whether MD elicits neural changes beyond visual processing is yet unclear. Here, we assessed the specific impact of MD on neural correlates of multisensory processes. Neural oscillations associated with visual and audio-visual processing were measured for both the deprived and the non-deprived eye. Results revealed that MD changed neural activities associated with visual and multisensory processes in an eye-specific manner. Selectively for the deprived eye, alpha synchronization was reduced within the first 150 ms of visual processing. Conversely, gamma activity was enhanced in response to audio-visual events only for the non-deprived eye within 100–300 ms after stimulus onset. The analysis of gamma responses to unisensory auditory events revealed that MD elicited a crossmodal upweight for the non-deprived eye. Distributed source modeling suggested that the right parietal cortex played a major role in neural effects induced by MD. Finally, visual and audio-visual processing alterations emerged for the induced component of the neural oscillations, indicating a prominent role of feedback connectivity. Results reveal the causal impact of MD on both unisensory (visual and auditory) and multisensory (audio-visual) processes and, their frequency-specific profiles. These findings support a model in which MD increases excitability to visual events for the deprived eye and audio-visual and auditory input for the non-deprived eye.","Federici, Alessandra;Bernardi, Giulio;Senna, Irene;Fantoni, Marta;Ernst, Marc O.;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Bottari, Davide",57193834248;54988409300;36461788300;57344015900;7201640221;8565770200;24365931900

However, it is still unclear whether the representation of coherent auditory and visual events requires any prior audiovisual experience to develop and function. Here we measured brain synchronization during the presentation of an audiovisual, audio-only or video-only version of the same narrative in distinct groups of sensory-deprived (congenitally blind and deaf) and typically developed individuals. Intersubject correlation analysis revealed that the superior temporal cortex was synchronized across auditory and visual conditions, even in sensory-deprived individuals who lack any audiovisual experience. This synchronization was primarily mediated by low-level perceptual features, and relied on a similar modality-independent topographical organization of slow temporal dynamics. The human superior temporal cortex is naturally endowed with a functional scaffolding to yield a common representation across multisensory events.","Setti, Francesca;Handjaras, Giacomo;Bottari, Davide;Leo, Andrea;Diano, Matteo;Bruno, Valentina;Tinti, Carla;Cecchetti, Luca;Garbarini, Francesca;Pietrini, Pietro;Ricciardi, Emiliano",57348732900;35748302500;24365931900;55311312500;55736418000;57194764008;7003386397;56625136900;6504829019;7005057128;8565770200
10.1093/braincomms/fcad232,0,"Visuospatial processing deficits are commonly observed in individuals with cerebral visual impairment, even in cases where visual acuity and visual field functions are intact. Cerebral visual impairment is a brain-based visual disorder associated with the maldevelopment of central visual pathways and structures. However, the neurophysiological basis underlying higher-order perceptual impairments in this condition has not been clearly identified, which in turn poses limits on developing rehabilitative interventions. Using combined eye tracking and EEG recordings, we assessed the profile and performance of visual search on a naturalistic virtual reality-based task. Participants with cerebral visual impairment and controls with neurotypical development were instructed to search, locate and fixate on a specific target placed among surrounding distractors at two levels of task difficulty. We analysed evoked (phase-locked) and induced (non-phase-locked) components of broadband (4-55â€ Hz) neural oscillations to uncover the neurophysiological basis of visuospatial processing. We found that visual search performance in cerebral visual impairment was impaired compared to controls (as indexed by outcomes of success rate, reaction time and gaze error). Analysis of neural oscillations revealed markedly reduced early-onset evoked theta [4-6â€ Hz] activity (within 0.5â€ s) regardless of task difficulty. Moreover, while induced alpha activity increased with task difficulty in controls, this modulation was absent in the cerebral visual impairment group identifying a potential neural correlate related to deficits with visual search and distractor suppression. Finally, cerebral visual impairment participants also showed a sustained induced gamma response [30-45â€ Hz]. We conclude that impaired visual search performance in cerebral visual impairment is associated with substantial alterations across a wide range of neural oscillation frequencies. This includes both evoked and induced components suggesting the involvement of feedforward and feedback processing as well as local and distributed levels of neural processing.","Federici, Alessandra;Bennett, Christopher R.;Bauer, Corinna M.;Manley, Claire E.;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Bottari, Davide;Merabet, Lotfi B.",57193834248;55385456500;36603985800;57877184300;8565770200;24365931900;6603146795

This study aimed to validate a new psychometric tool for assessing TS in an Italian banking context, the Work-Related Technostress – Questionnaire (WRT-Q).

Reliability, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), ANCOVA, independent sample t-test, and correlation analyses were performed. Results: The WRT-Q consisted of 17 items and a four-factor structure, supported by the following CFA indices: Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0.985; Incremental Fit Index (IFI) = 0.985; Goodness of Fit (GFI) = 0.988; Root Mean Squared Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.071; and SRMR = 0.062. A significant difference in TS levels between age classes emerged (p < 0.001) with higher levels in the over 55-year-old subgroup, while no statistically significant difference emerged for gender. Moreover, the whole sample found a significant positive association between age and TS (p < 0.001).

In this work, we investigate the consequences of the pandemic shock on the dynamics of new donors exploiting the individual-level longitudinal information contained in administrative data on the Italian region of Tuscany. We compare the change in new donors' recruitment and retention during 2020 with respect to the 2017–2019 period (we observe 9511 individuals), considering donors’ and their municipalities of residence characteristics. Our results show an increment of new donors, with higher proportional growth for older donors. Moreover, we demonstrate that the quality of new donors, as proxied by the frequency of subsequent donations, increased with respect to previous years. Finally, we show that changes in extrinsic motivations, such as the possibility of obtaining a free antibody test or overcoming movement restrictions, cannot explain the documented increase in the number of new donors and in their performance.

Notwithstanding the role of these properties in perceptual grouping, studies highlighted differences in disembedding performance across individuals, which are summarized by the field dependence dimension. Evidence suggests that age and educational attainment explain part of this variability, whereas the role of sex is still highly debated. Also, which stimulus features primarily influence inter-individual variations in perceptual grouping has still to be fully determined. Building upon these premises, we assessed the role of age, education level, and sex on performance at the Leuven Embedded Figure Test—a proxy of disembedding abilities—in 391 cisgender individuals. We also investigated to what extent shape symmetry, closure, complexity, and continuation relate to task accuracy. Overall, target asymmetry, closure, and good continuation with the embedding context increase task difficulty. Simpler shapes are more difficult to detect than those with more lines, yet context complexity impairs the recognition of complex targets (i.e., those with 6 lines or more) to a greater extent. Concerning demographic data, we confirm that age and educational attainment are significantly associated with disembedding abilities and reveal a perceptual advantage in males. In summary, our study further highlights the role of shape properties in disembedding performance and unveils sex differences not reported so far.","Cappello, Elisa Morgana;Lettieri, Giada;Malizia, Andrea Patricelli;d’Arcangelo, Sonia;Handjaras, Giacomo;Lattanzi, Nicola;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Cecchetti, Luca",57348734100;56680972900;16028897900;57463509700;35748302500;56136055200;8565770200;56625136900

In this study, we compared the predictive power of different classes of models, i.e., (i) traditional Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), with two families of Machine Learning algorithms: (ii) regressors, specifically least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) for feature selection and (iii) classifiers, specifically Bagging meta-model with the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) as a base estimator. Our aim is to investigate which method better predicts job satisfaction for 348 employees (with operational duties) and 35 supervisors in the training set, and 79 employees in the test set, all subject to internal mobility programs in a large Italian banking group. Results showed average predictive power for SEM and Bagging k-NN (accuracy between 61 and 66%; F1 scores between 0.51 and 0.73). Both SEM and Lasso algorithms highlighted the predictive power of resistance to change and orientation to relation in all models, together with other personality and motivation variables in different models. Theoretical implications are discussed for using these variables in predicting successful job relocation in internal mobility programs.

10.3389/fpsyg.2022.843095,14,"The COVID-19 evolution has forced the massive introduction of homeworking (HW) for most employees in the initial stages of the pandemic and then return to work, mainly due to the vaccination campaign. These multiple abrupt adjustment demands in work may be a source of intense stress for office workers with consequences on wellbeing and the quality of life. This long-term prospective study aimed at investigating the effect of adaptation demands on a broad population of employees of a large Italian banking group in the job-related stress framework. We administered a web-based survey to 1,264 participants in Reopening after the first lockdown, from June to October 2020, at 841 subjects in Second Wave, corresponding to the rise of contagions from November 2020 to January 2021, and to 491 individuals in Vaccination Round, which ranged from February to June 2021. We assessed workaholism by using the Dutch Work Addiction Scale (DUWAS-10), work-family conflicting overlap by using the Work and Family Conflict Scale (WAFCS), and concern for back to work (BW) and for HW by specific questions. Higher WAFCS scores characterized Reopening and Vaccination Round while Second Wave had the highest level of concern for HW. Women and younger individuals showed the highest concern for BW, WAFCS, and DUWAS-10 scores regardless of the pandemic stage. HW days per week were related to more heightened concern for BW and lower concern for HW, DUWAS, and WAFCS scores. The number of children was related to lower Concern for BW and higher WAFCS scores in Reopening and Second Wave. Our data showed that massive adjustment demands in work and family routine represented a significant source of stress for employees, regardless of the different pandemic stages. The highest level of fatigue emerged in women and younger subjects. These results shed light on the need for a road map to promote a gradual and structured adjustment for workers and encourage organizations to consider homeworking as a valid stable alternative.","Orfei, Maria Donata;Porcari, Desirée Estela;D’Arcangelo, Sonia;Maggi, Francesca;Russignaga, Dario;Lattanzi, Nicola;Malizia, Andrea Patricelli;Ricciardi, Emiliano",57192322263;57220078252;57463509700;57232266500;6506912623;56136055200;16028897900;8565770200
,0,"Escape from the Castle is a digital escape game created with the collaboration of the Museum of Saving in Turin (Italy), Neuroscience Lab Intesa Sanpaolo Innovation Center, and the GAME Science Research Center of IMT School for Ad-vanced Studies Lucca. In the escape game, players must help Mica, the mascot of the Museum, to run away from the Ghost of the Baroness, from its Castle. To do that, every player has to solve four puzzles in four different rooms. Each room is correlated to a financial issue, such as saving strategies and planning. The game aims to increase the awareness that money represents a means for achieving a purpose (i.e., use value of money) and not an end, from a behavioural and neuroscientific point of view. So we built a study about the behaviour of teenagers. According to the literature, the cooperative approach proposes emotional and cognitive involvement as a tool to strengthen learning, increases awareness of self-efficacy and, when applied to money management, increases the self-perception of being able to make consumption choices. To better understand the mechanisms of cooperation, we built an experiment with 118 students from eleven to fourteen years old, that played the game during a visit to the Museum. We divided students into two groups: one in which students could collaborate with each other in solving the puzzles (treatment) and one in which they had to play individually (control), and we collected score and time of play (behavioural data). In each group, two students wore eye-trackers to record pupil dilation to collect neurophysiological data. Here we present mainly the behavioural results that show that the students who were allowed to collaborate obtained, on average, double the score compared to those who played individually. Furthermore, those who collaborated finished the game in less time than those who have not played as a group. Moreover, combining behavioural data with neurophysiological data, there are indications that high pupil dilation is correlated with high engage-ment in play, and this is often true in collaborating groups.","Bisanti, Matteo;Di Paolo, Roberto;Pizziol, Veronica;Accardi, Sebastiano;Maggi, Francesca;Paladino, Giovanna;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Bilancini, Ennio",26026262000;57201116811;57226799439;57951273700;57232266500;6603147464;8565770200;24175889200
10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118574,0,"Functional Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (fQSM) allows for the quantitative measurement of time-varying magnetic susceptibility across cortical and subcortical brain structures with a potentially higher spatial specificity than conventional fMRI. While the usefulness of fQSM with General Linear Model and “On/Off” paradigms has been assessed, little is known about the potential applications and limitations of this technique in more sophisticated experimental paradigms and analyses, such as those currently used in modern neuroimaging. To thoroughly characterize fQSM activations, here we used 7T MRI, tonotopic mapping, as well as univariate (i.e., GLM and population Receptive Field) and multivariate (Representational Similarity Analysis; RSA) analyses. Although fQSM detected less tone-responsive voxels than fMRI, they were more consistently localized in gray matter. Also, the majority of active gray matter voxels exhibited negative fQSM response, signaling the expected oxyhemoglobin increase, whereas positive fQSM activations were mainly in white matter. Though fMRI- and fQSM-based tonotopic maps were overall comparable, the representation of frequency tunings in tone-sensitive regions was significantly more balanced for fQSM. Lastly, RSA revealed that frequency information from the auditory cortex could be successfully retrieved by using either methods. Overall, fQSM produces complementary results to conventional fMRI, as it captures small-scale variations in the activation pattern which inform multivariate measures. Although positive fQSM responses deserve further investigation, they do not impair the interpretation of contrasts of interest. The quantitative nature of fQSM, its spatial specificity and the possibility to simultaneously acquire canonical fMRI support the use of this technique for longitudinal and multicentric studies and pre-surgical mapping.","Lancione, Marta;Costagli, Mauro;Handjaras, Giacomo;Tosetti, Michela;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Pietrini, Pietro;Cecchetti, Luca",57195628629;22333629800;35748302500;6701756843;8565770200;7005057128;56625136900

In experiment 1, performance relied on local features analysis; in experiment 2, performance benefited from computing global representations. In both experiments, SC and CB performance remarkably overlapped. Conversely, LB performed systematically worse than the other groups when relying on local features, with no alterations on global representations. Results suggest that auditory computations tested here develop independently from vision.

Although it is known that a network encompassing fronto-cingulate and parietal brain areas is engaged during successful emotion regulation, the functional mechanisms underlying failures in emotion suppression (ES) are still unclear. In order to investigate this issue, we analyzed video and high-density EEG recordings of 20 healthy adult participants during an ES and a free expression task performed on two consecutive days. Changes in facial expression during ES, but not free expression, were preceded by local increases in sleep-like activity (1–4 Hz) in brain areas responsible for emotional suppression, including bilateral anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex, and in right middle/inferior frontal gyrus ( p < .05, corrected). Moreover, shorter sleep duration the night before the ES experiment correlated with the number of behavioral errors ( p = .03) and tended to be associated with higher frontal sleep-like activity during ES failures ( p = .09). These results indicate that local sleep-like activity may represent the cause of ES failures in humans and may offer a functional explanation for previous observations linking lack of sleep, changes in frontal activity, and emotional dysregulation.","Avvenuti, Giulia;Bertelloni, Davide;Lettieri, Giada;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Cecchetti, Luca;Pietrini, Pietro;Bernardi, Giulio",57188638994;57221353204;56680972900;8565770200;56625136900;7005057128;54988409300

We observed partially overlapping networks for cognitive and affective mentalizing in the medial prefrontal, posterior cingulate, and lateral temporal cortex, while empathy mainly engaged fronto-insular, somatosensory, and anterior cingulate cortex. Adjacent process-specific regions in the posterior lateral temporal, ventrolateral, and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex might underpin a transition from abstract representations of cognitive mental states detached from sensory facets to emotionally-charged representations of affective mental states. Altered mentalizing-related activity involved distinct sectors of the posterior lateral temporal cortex in schizophrenia and autism, while only the latter group displayed abnormal empathy related activity in the amygdala. These data might inform the design of rehabilitative treatments for social cognitive deficits.","Arioli, Maria;Cattaneo, Zaira;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Canessa, Nicola",57200574723;13404162300;8565770200;24334215800

Neural responses are typically reduced upon stimulus repetition, a phenomenon called Repetition Suppression (RS). On the contrary, following a novel visual stimulus, the neural response is generally enhanced, a phenomenon referred to as Novelty Detection (ND). Here, we aimed to investigate the impact of early deafness on the oscillatory signatures of RS and ND brain responses. To this aim, electrophysiological data were acquired in early deaf and hearing control individuals during processing of repeated and novel visual events unattended by participants. By studying evoked and induced oscillatory brain activities, as well as inter-trial phase coherence, we linked response modulations to feedback and/or feedforward processes. Results revealed selective experience-dependent changes on both RS and ND mechanisms. Compared to hearing controls, early deaf individuals displayed: (i) greater attenuation of the response following stimulus repetition, selectively in the induced theta-band (4–7 Hz); (ii) reduced desynchronization following the onset of novel visual stimuli, in the induced alpha and beta bands (8–12 and 13–25 Hz); (iii) comparable modulation of evoked responses and inter-trial phase coherence. The selectivity of the effects in the induced responses parallels findings observed in the auditory cortex of deaf animal models following intracochlear electric stimulation. The present results support the idea that early deafness alters induced oscillatory activity and the functional tuning of basic visual processing.","Bednaya, Evgenia;Pavani, Francesco;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Pietrini, Pietro;Bottari, Davide",57218763452;6603904412;8565770200;7005057128;24365931900

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118117,7,"EEG slow waves, the hallmarks of NREM sleep are thought to be crucial for the regulation of several important processes, including learning, sensory disconnection and the removal of brain metabolic wastes. Animal research indicates that slow waves may involve complex interactions within and between cortical and subcortical structures. Conventional EEG in humans, however, has a low spatial resolution and is unable to accurately describe changes in the activity of subcortical and deep cortical structures. To overcome these limitations, here we took advantage of simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings to map cortical and subcortical hemodynamic (BOLD) fluctuations time-locked to slow waves of light sleep. Recordings were performed in twenty healthy adults during an afternoon nap. Slow waves were associated with BOLD-signal increases in the posterior brainstem and in portions of thalamus and cerebellum characterized by preferential functional connectivity with limbic and somatomotor areas, respectively. At the cortical level, significant BOLD-signal decreases were instead found in several areas, including insula and somatomotor cortex. Specifically, a slow signal increase preceded slow-wave onset and was followed by a delayed, stronger signal decrease. Similar hemodynamic changes were found to occur at different delays across most cortical brain areas, mirroring the propagation of electrophysiological slow waves, from centro-frontal to inferior temporo-occipital cortices. Finally, we found that the amplitude of electrophysiological slow waves was positively related to the magnitude and inversely related to the delay of cortical and subcortical BOLD-signal changes. These regional patterns of brain activity are consistent with theoretical accounts of the functions of sleep slow waves.","Betta, Monica;Handjaras, Giacomo;Leo, Andrea;Federici, Alessandra;Farinelli, Valentina;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Siclari, Francesca;Meletti, Stefano;Ballotta, Daniela;Benuzzi, Francesca;Bernardi, Giulio",55904308300;35748302500;55311312500;57193834248;36165324000;8565770200;36764231300;6701670785;56539993300;6602925063;54988409300

10.1093/sleep/zsaa247,12,"Functional connectivity (FC) metrics describe brain inter-regional interactions and may complement information provided by common power-based analyses. Here, we investigated whether the FC-metrics weighted Phase Lag Index (wPLI) and weighted Symbolic Mutual Information (wSMI) may unveil functional differences across four stages of vigilance - wakefulness (W), NREM-N2, NREM-N3, and REM sleep - with respect to each other and to power-based features. Moreover, we explored their possible contribution in identifying differences between stages characterized by distinct levels of consciousness (REM+W vs. N2+N3) or sensory disconnection (REM vs. W). Overnight sleep and resting-state wakefulness recordings from 24 healthy participants (27 ± 6 years, 13F) were analyzed to extract power and FC-based features in six classical frequency bands. Cross-validated linear discriminant analyses (LDA) were applied to investigate the ability of extracted features to discriminate (1) the four vigilance stages, (2) W+REM vs. N2+N3, and (3) W vs. REM. For the four-way vigilance stages classification, combining features based on power and both connectivity metrics significantly increased accuracy relative to considering only power, wPLI, or wSMI features. Delta-power and connectivity (0.5-4 Hz) represented the most relevant features for all the tested classifications, in line with a possible involvement of slow waves in consciousness and sensory disconnection. Sigma-FC, but not sigma-power (12-16 Hz), was found to strongly contribute to the differentiation between states characterized by higher (W+REM) and lower (N2+N3) probabilities of conscious experiences. Finally, alpha-FC resulted as the most relevant FC-feature for distinguishing among wakefulness and REM sleep and may thus reflect the level of disconnection from the external environment.","Imperatori, Laura Sophie;Cataldi, Jacinthe;Betta, Monica;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Ince, Robin A.A.;Siclari, Francesca;Bernardi, Giulio",57209394751;57204429555;55904308300;8565770200;36852225800;36764231300;54988409300
10.1007/s40520-019-01280-w,15,"Background and aims: Cognitive impairments associated with aging and dementia are major sources of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPs) and deterioration in quality of life (QoL). Preventive measures to both reduce disease and improve QoL in those affected are increasingly targeting individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at early disease stage. However, NPs and QoL outcomes are too commonly overlooked in intervention trials. The purpose of this study was to test the effects of physical and cognitive training on NPs and QoL in MCI. Methods: Baseline data from an MCI court (N = 93, mean age 74.9 ± 4.7) enrolled in the Train the Brain (TtB) study were collected. Subjects were randomized in two groups: a group participated to a cognitive and physical training program, while the other sticked to usual standard care. Both groups underwent a follow-up re-evaluation after 7 months from baseline. NPs were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and QoL was assessed using Quality of Life-Alzheimer’s Disease (QOL-AD) scale. Results: After 7 months of training, training group exhibited a significant reduction of NPs and a significant increase in QOL-AD with respect to no-training group (p = 0.0155, p = 0.0013, respectively). Our preliminary results suggest that a combined training can reduce NPs and improve QoL. Conclusions: Measuring QoL outcomes is a potentially important factor in ensuring that a person with cognitive deficits can ‘live well’ with pathology. Future data from non-pharmacological interventions, with a larger sample and a longer follow-up period, could confirm the results and the possible implications for such prevention strategies for early cognitive decline.","Cintoli, Simona;Radicchi, Claudia;Noale, Marianna;Maggi, Stefania;Meucci, Giuseppe;Tognoni, Gloria;Bonuccelli, Ubaldo;Sale, Alessandro;Berardi, Nicoletta;Maffei, Lamberto;Picano, E.;Andreassi, M.

10.1002/hbm.25289,10,"Social cognition skills are typically acquired on the basis of visual information (e.g., the observation of gaze, facial expressions, gestures). In light of this, a critical issue is whether and how the lack of visual experience affects neurocognitive mechanisms underlying social skills. This issue has been largely neglected in the literature on blindness, despite difficulties in social interactions may be particular salient in the life of blind individuals (especially children). Here we provide a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies reporting brain activations associated to the representation of self and others' in early blind individuals and in sighted controls. Our results indicate that early blindness does not critically impact on the development of the “social brain,” with social tasks performed on the basis of auditory or tactile information driving consistent activations in nodes of the action observation network, typically active during actual observation of others in sighted individuals. Interestingly though, activations along this network appeared more left-lateralized in the blind than in sighted participants. These results may have important implications for the development of specific training programs to improve social skills in blind children and young adults.","Arioli, Maria;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Cattaneo, Zaira",57200574723;8565770200;13404162300

But what are the effects of the quarantine imposed by the states that implemented the measures of lockdown? The present research aims to explore, in a preliminary way, the major stress-related symptoms during the lockdown, due to Covid-19, in the Italian population. Subjects were asked to fill out a survey, that traced a line identifying the most relevant psychophysiological symptoms that took into account factors such as perceived stress, body perception, perceived pain, quality of sleep, perceptive variations (i.e., olfactory, gustatory, visual, acoustic, and haptic perception). A network approach formulating a hypothesis-generating exploratory analysis was adopted. Main results of the network analysis showed that the beliefs of having had the Covid-19 was related to individual variables (i.e., gender, working in presence, sleep quality, anxiety symptoms), while the familiarity of Covid-19 disease was related to contextual factors (e.g., number of recorded cases in the Region, working in presence). The self-perception of olfactory and perceptive alterations highlighted a great sensorial cross-modality, additionally, the olfactory impairment was related to the belief of having had the Covid-19. Compared to general network data, BAI, perceived stress, anxiety and chronic pain were in relation to daily sleep disturbance. Main study's results show how the management of the Covid-19 stressful representation, in its cognitive aspects, can modulate the psychophysiological responses.","Invitto, Sara;Romano, Daniele;Garbarini, Francesca;Bruno, Valentina;Urgesi, Cosimo;Curcio, Giuseppe;Grasso, Alberto;Pellicciari, Maria Concetta;Kock, Giacomo;Betti, Viviana;Fiorio, Mirta;Ricciardi, Emiliano;de Tommaso, Marina;Valeriani, Massimiliano",54382017700;55558507000;6504829019;57194764008;9742147000;6701578294;57213608940;6504027566;57222736371;23501031500;6603838408;8565770200;7004747853;7006184222
10.3389/fnins.2020.577978,6,"The frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) is a neurophysiological measure of motivation and preference. Despite the FAA is associated to commercial pleasantness, conflicting evidence emerged in the literature regarding its relationship with behavior. To study the association between FAA and consumers' decision, we manipulated a commercial script to elicit diverse consumers' attitudes and decisions and to evaluate whether the FAA score is associated to their final investment. A little informative script (S1) was used to polarize consumers' attitudes and investments toward unfavorable scores, while a more personalized message (S2) to elicit in customers a favorable attitude and higher investments. Twenty-one participants listened to the scripts, and their FAA, attitude, and monetary investment were measured. In S1, the FAA did not correlate with neither attitude nor the investment decision, while a robust negative correlation between these variables was found in S2. No other peripheral body and neural measures associated with attitude or final decision. Our data suggest that the FAA correlates with attitude and decision, when a commercial script is customized and provides an adequate information, likely leading the consumer to a more reasoned and planned decision-making process. When facilitating a favorable attitude toward an offer, the negative correlation of FAA and behavior may reflect the involvement of a control system, whose role is to monitor and govern possible conflicts between approach and avoidance motivations. This observation provides additional indication on the value of FAA as a marker of consumer behaviors, and how it could be affected by experimental and contextual bias.","Di Gruttola, Francesco;Malizia, Andrea P.;D'Arcangelo, Sonia;Lattanzi, Nicola;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Orfei, Maria Donata",56324294200;16028897900;57221913690;56136055200;8565770200;57192322263
10.1093/braincomms/fcab108,5,"Sleep spindles of non-REM sleep are transient, waxing-and-waning 10-16 Hz EEG oscillations, whose cortical synchronization depends on the engagement of thalamo-cortical loops. However, previous studies in animal models lacking the corpus callosum due to agenesis or total callosotomy and in humans with agenesis of the corpus callosum suggested that cortico-cortical connections may also have a relevant role in cortical (inter-hemispheric) spindle synchronization. Yet, most of these works did not provide direct quantitative analyses to support their observations. By studying a rare sample of callosotomized, split-brain patients, we recently demonstrated that the total resection of the corpus callosum is associated with a significant reduction in the inter-hemispheric propagation of non-REM slow waves. Interestingly, sleep spindles are often temporally and spatially grouped around slow waves (0.5-4 Hz), and this coordination is thought to have an important role in sleep-dependent learning and memory consolidation. Given these premises, here we set out to investigate whether total callosotomy may affect the generation and spreading of sleep spindles, as well as their coupling with sleep slow waves. To this aim, we analysed overnight high-density EEG recordings (256 electrodes) collected in five patients who underwent total callosotomy due to drug-resistant epilepsy (age 40-53, two females), three non-callosotomized neurological patients (age 44-66, two females), and in a sample of 24 healthy adult control subjects (age 20-47, 13 females). Individual sleep spindles were automatically detected using a validated algorithm and their properties and topographic distributions were computed. All analyses were performed with and without a regression-based adjustment accounting for inter-subject age differences. The comparison between callosotomized patients and healthy subjects did not reveal systematic variations in spindle density, amplitude or frequency. However, callosotomized patients were characterized by a reduced spindle duration, which could represent the result of a faster desynchronization of spindle activity across cortical areas of the two hemispheres. In contrast with our previous findings regarding sleep slow waves, we failed to detect in callosotomized patients any clear, systematic change in the inter-hemispheric synchronization of sleep spindles. In line with this, callosotomized patients were characterized by a reduced extension of the spatial association between temporally coupled spindles and slow waves. Our findings are consistent with a dependence of spindles on thalamo-cortical rather than cortico-cortical connections in humans, but also revealed that, despite their temporal association, slow waves and spindles are independently regulated in terms of topographic expression.","Bernardi, Giulio;Avvenuti, Giulia;Cataldi, Jacinthe;Lattanzi, Simona;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Polonara, Gabriele;Silvestrini, Mauro;Siclari, Francesca;Fabri, Mara;Bellesi, Michele",54988409300;57188638994;57204429555;55356677100;8565770200;6601977298;36868778200;36764231300;7005829601;7801530324

10.1152/jn.00212.2020,4,"Object recognition relies on different transformations of the retinal input, carried out by the visual system, that range from local contrast to object shape and category. While some of those transformations are thought to occur at specific stages of the visual hierarchy, the features they represent are correlated (e.g., object shape and identity) and selectivity for the same feature overlaps in many brain regions. This may be explained either by collinearity across representations or may instead reflect the coding of multiple dimensions by the same cortical population. Moreover, orthogonal and shared components may differently impact distinctive stages of the visual hierarchy. We recorded functional MRI activity while participants passively attended to object images and employed a statistical approach that partitioned orthogonal and shared object representations to reveal their relative impact on brain processing. Orthogonal shape representations (silhouette, curvature, and medial axis) independently explained distinct and overlapping clusters of selectivity in the occitotemporal and parietal cortex. Moreover, we show that the relevance of shared representations linearly increases moving from posterior to anterior regions. These results indicate that the visual cortex encodes shared relations between different features in a topographic fashion and that object shape is encoded along different dimensions, each representing orthogonal features.","Papale, Paolo;Leo, Andrea;Handjaras, Giacomo;Cecchetti, Luca;Pietrini, Pietro;Ricciardi, Emiliano",57190440455;55311312500;35748302500;56625136900;7005057128;8565770200

The EEG was recorded to visual stimuli presented at a rate of 6 Hz, with oddball stimuli at a rate of 1.2 Hz. In all three experiments and in both groups, significant face discriminative responses were found. Face-Object categorization was associated to a relative increased involvement of the left hemisphere in CD individuals compared to HC individuals. A similar trend was observed for Emotional Facial-Expression discrimination but not for Individual Face Discrimination. Source reconstruction suggested a greater activation of the auditory cortices in the CD group for Individual Face Discrimination.

10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2571-19.2020,19,"The slow waves of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep reflect experience-dependent plasticity and play a direct role in the restorative functions of sleep. Importantly, slow waves behave as traveling waves, and their propagation is assumed to occur through cortico-cortical white matter connections. In this light, the corpus callosum (CC) may represent the main responsible for cross-hemispheric slow-wave propagation. To verify this hypothesis, we performed overnight high-density (hd)- EEG recordings in five patients who underwent total callosotomy due to drug-resistant epilepsy (CPs; two females), in three noncallosotomized neurologic patients (NPs; two females), and in a sample of 24 healthy adult subjects (HSs; 13 females). In all CPs slow waves displayed a significantly reduced probability of cross-hemispheric propagation and a stronger interhemispheric asymmetry. In both CPs and HSs, the incidence of large slow waves within individual NREM epochs tended to differ across hemispheres, with a relative overall predominance of the right over the left hemisphere. The absolute magnitude of this asymmetry was greater in CPs relative to HSs. However, the CC resection had no significant effects on the distribution of slow-wave origin probability across hemispheres. The present results indicate that CC integrity is essential for the crosshemispheric traveling of slow waves in human sleep, which is in line with the assumption of a direct relationship between white matter integrity and slow-wave propagation. Our findings also revealed a residual cross-hemispheric slow-wave propagation that may rely on alternative pathways, including cortico-subcortico-cortical loops. Finally, these data indicate that the lack of the CC does not lead to differences in slow-wave generation across brain hemispheres.","Avvenuti, Giulia;Handjaras, Giacomo;Betta, Monica;Cataldi, Jacinthe;Imperatori, Laura Sophie;Lattanzi, Simona;Riedner, Brady A.;Pietrini, Pietro;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Tononi, Giulio;Siclari, Francesca;Polonara, Gabriele;Fabri, Mara;Silvestrini, Mauro;Bellesi, Michele;Bernardi, Giulio",57188638994;35748302500;55904308300;57204429555;57209394751;55356677100;14323814400;7005057128;8565770200;7006294703;36764231300;6601977298;7005829601;36868778200;7801530324;54988409300

Here we assess the effect of this flexibility on the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging by asking 70 independent teams to analyse the same dataset, testing the same 9 ex-ante hypotheses1. The flexibility of analytical approaches is exemplified by the fact that no two teams chose identical workflows to analyse the data. This flexibility resulted in sizeable variation in the results of hypothesis tests, even for teams whose statistical maps were highly correlated at intermediate stages of the analysis pipeline. Variation in reported results was related to several aspects of analysis methodology. Notably, a meta-analytical approach that aggregated information across teams yielded a significant consensus in activated regions. Furthermore, prediction markets of researchers in the field revealed an overestimation of the likelihood of significant findings, even by researchers with direct knowledge of the dataset2–5. Our findings show that analytical flexibility can have substantial effects on scientific conclusions, and identify factors that may be related to variability in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging.

10.1016/j.sleep.2019.12.030,11,"Sudden drops in pulse wave amplitude (PWA) measured by finger photoplethysmography (PPG) are known to reflect peripheral vasoconstriction resulting from sympathetic activation. Previous work demonstrated that sympathetic activations during sleep typically accompany the occurrence of pathological respiratory and motor events, and their alteration may be associated with the arising of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Importantly, PWA-drops often occur in the absence of visually identifiable cortical micro-arousals and may thus represent a more accurate marker of sleep disruption/fragmentation. In this light, an objective and reproducible quantification and characterization of sleep-related PWA-drops may offer a valuable, non-invasive approach for the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of patients with sleep disorders. However, the manual identification of PWA-drops represents a time-consuming practice potentially associated with high intra/inter-scorer variability. Since validated algorithms are not readily available for research and clinical purposes, here we present a novel automated approach to detect and characterize significant drops in the PWA-signal. The algorithm was tested against expert human scorers who visually inspected corresponding PPG-recordings. Results demonstrated that the algorithm reliably detects PWA-drops and is able to characterize them in terms of parameters with a potential physiological and clinical relevance, including timing, amplitude, duration and slopes. The method is completely user-independent, processes all-night PSG-data, automatically dealing with potential artefacts, sensor loss/displacements, and stage-dependent variability in PWA-time-series.

Previous work showed that relatively brief period of TM practice leads to decreases in stress and anxiety. However, whether these changes are subserved by specific morpho-functional brain modifications (as observed in other meditation techniques) is still unclear. Using a longitudinal design, we combined psychometric questionnaires, structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) to investigate the potential brain modifications underlying the psychological effects of TM. The final sample included 19 naïve subjects instructed to complete two daily 20-min TM sessions, and 15 volunteers in the control group. Both groups were evaluated at recruitment (T0) and after 3 months (T1). At T1, only meditators showed a decrease in perceived anxiety and stress (t(18) = 2.53, p = 0.02), which correlated negatively with T1-T0 changes in functional connectivity among posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus and left superior parietal lobule. Additionally, TM practice was associated with increased connectivity between PCC and right insula, likely reflecting changes in interoceptive awareness. No structural changes were observed in meditators or control subjects. These preliminary findings indicate that beneficial effects of TM may be mediated by functional brain changes that take place after a short practice period of 3 months.","Avvenuti, Giulia;Leo, Andrea;Cecchetti, Luca;Franco, Maria Fatima;Travis, Frederick;Caramella, Davide;Bernardi, Giulio;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Pietrini, Pietro",57188638994;55311312500;56625136900;57213354080;7003786105;7006901509;54988409300;8565770200;7005057128

However, which mechanisms link descriptions of affective states to brain activity is unclear, with evidence supporting either local or distributed processing. A biologically favorable alternative is provided by the notion of gradient, which postulates the isomorphism between functional representations of stimulus features and cortical distance. Here, we use fMRI activity evoked by an emotionally charged movie and continuous ratings of the perceived emotion intensity to reveal the topographic organization of affective states. Results show that three orthogonal and spatially overlapping gradients encode the polarity, complexity and intensity of emotional experiences in right temporo-parietal territories. The spatial arrangement of these gradients allows the brain to map a variety of affective states within a single patch of cortex. As this organization resembles how sensory regions represent psychophysical properties (e.g., retinotopy), we propose emotionotopy as a principle of emotion coding.","Lettieri, Giada;Handjaras, Giacomo;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Leo, Andrea;Papale, Paolo;Betta, Monica;Pietrini, Pietro;Cecchetti, Luca",56680972900;35748302500;8565770200;55311312500;57190440455;55904308300;7005057128;56625136900

Interestingly, both methods have been shown to detect relative alterations of brain functional connectivity in conditions associated with changes in the level of consciousness, such as following severe brain injury or under anaesthesia. Despite these promising findings, it was unclear whether wPLI and wSMI may account for distinct or similar types of functional interactions. Using simulated high-density (hd-)EEG data, we demonstrate that, while wPLI has high sensitivity for couplings presenting a mixture of linear and nonlinear interdependencies, only wSMI can detect purely nonlinear interaction dynamics. Moreover, we evaluated the potential impact of these differences on real experimental data by computing wPLI and wSMI connectivity in hd-EEG recordings of 12 healthy adults during wakefulness and deep (N3-)sleep, characterised by different levels of consciousness. In line with the simulation-based findings, this analysis revealed that both methods have different sensitivity for changes in brain connectivity across the two vigilance states.

Relevant features span from simple low-level properties, as contrast and spatial frequencies, to object-based attributes, as shape and category. However, how these features are integrated into coherent percepts is still debated. Moreover, these dimensions often share common biases: for instance, stimuli from the same category (e.g., tools) may have similar shapes. Here, using magnetoencephalography, we revealed the temporal dynamics of feature processing in human subjects attending to objects from six semantic categories. By employing Relative Weights Analysis, we mitigated collinearity between model-based descriptions of stimuli and showed that low-level properties (contrast and spatial frequencies), shape (medial-axis) and category are represented within the same spatial locations early in time: 100–150 ms after stimulus onset. This fast and overlapping processing may result from independent parallel computations, with categorical representation emerging later than the onset of low-level feature processing, yet before shape coding. Categorical information is represented both before and after shape, suggesting a role for this feature in the refinement of categorical matching.","Papale, Paolo;Betta, Monica;Handjaras, Giacomo;Malfatti, Giulia;Cecchetti, Luca;Rampinini, Alessandra;Pietrini, Pietro;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Turella, Luca;Leo, Andrea",57190440455;55904308300;35748302500;57208881629;56625136900;57190443337;7005057128;8565770200;15520235500;55311312500

Here, the response of the auditory cortex to the presentation of short acoustic stimuli has been studied with fQSM. fQSM responses to stimuli were obtained by using a data-driven approach based on signal deconvolution to avoid assumptions regarding the response shape. fQSM and BOLD responses showed similar shapes, however, while the majority (82%) of fQSM responses described transient decreases in magnetic susceptibility (explainable by the same mechanisms behind the typical, positive BOLD responses), some voxels exhibited transient increments in magnetic susceptibility, which might reflect the interplay among changes in fractional oxygen saturation, cerebral blood flow, and volume. Statistically significant fQSM responses were observed not only in veins (which constitute the largest sources of magnetic susceptibility contrast) but also in gray matter tissue, suggesting that this technique is sensitive to subtle, stimulus-dependent changes also in the parenchyma, and therefore it might be useful to localize and interpret the sources of activation.","Costagli, Mauro;Lancione, Marta;Cecchetti, Luca;Pietrini, Pietro;Cosottini, Mirco;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Tosetti, Michela",22333629800;57195628629;56625136900;7005057128;55999935600;8565770200;6701756843
10.1152/jn.00085.2019,14,"Previous studies have shown that regional slow-wave activity (SWA) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is modulated by prior experience and learning. Although this effect has been convincingly demonstrated for the sensorimotor domain, attempts to extend these findings to the visual system have provided mixed results. In this study we asked whether depriving subjects of external visual stimuli during daytime would lead to regional changes in slow waves during sleep and whether the degree of “internal visual stimulation” (spontaneous imagery) would influence such changes. In two 8-h sessions spaced 1 wk apart, 12 healthy volunteers either were blindfolded while listening to audiobooks or watched movies (control condition), after which their sleep was recorded with high-density EEG. We found that during NREM sleep, the number of small, local slow waves in the occipital cortex decreased after listening with blindfolding relative to movie watching in a way that depended on the degree of visual imagery subjects reported during blindfolding: subjects with low visual imagery showed a significant reduction of occipital sleep slow waves, whereas those who reported a high degree of visual imagery did not. We also found a positive relationship between the reliance on visual imagery during blindfolding and audiobook listening and the degree of correlation in sleep SWA between visual areas and language-related areas. These preliminary results demonstrate that short-term alterations in visual experience may trigger slow-wave changes in cortical visual areas. Furthermore, they suggest that plasticity- related EEG changes during sleep may reflect externally induced (“bottom up”) visual experiences, as well as internally generated (“top down”) processes. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Previous work has shown that slow-wave activity, a marker of sleep depth, is linked to neural plasticity in the sensorimotor cortex. We show that after short-term visual deprivation, subjects who reported little visual imagery had a reduced incidence of occipital slow waves. This effect was absent in subjects who reported strong spontaneous visual imagery. These findings suggest that visual imagery may “substitute” for visual perception and induce similar changes in non-rapid eye movement slow waves.","Bernardi, Giulio;Betta, Monica;Cataldi, Jacinthe;Leo, Andrea;Haba-Rubio, José;Heinzer, Raphaël;Cirelli, Chiara;Tononi, Giulio;Pietrini, Pietro;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Siclari, Francesca",54988409300;55904308300;57204429555;55311312500;55948208000;55623598100;7003312242;7006294703;7005057128;8565770200;36764231300
10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2298-18.2019,82,"Although the EEG slow wave of sleep is typically considered to be a hallmark of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, recent work in mice has shown that slow waves can also occur inREMsleep. Here, we investigated the presence and cortical distribution of negative delta (1- 4 Hz) waves in human REM sleep by analyzing high-density EEG sleep recordings obtained in 28 healthy subjects. We identified two clusters of delta waves with distinctive properties: (1) a frontal-central cluster characterized by ~2.5-3.0 Hz, relatively large, notched delta waves (so-called “sawtooth waves”) that tended to occur in bursts, were associated with increased gamma activity and rapid eye movements (EMs), and upon source modeling displayed an occipital-temporal and a frontal-central component and (2) a medialoccipital cluster characterized by more isolated, slower (<2 Hz), and smaller waves that were not associated with rapid EMs, displayed a negative correlation with gamma activity, and were also found inNREMsleep. Therefore, delta waves are an integral part ofREMsleep in humans and the two identified subtypes (sawtooth and medial-occipital slow waves) may reflect distinct generation mechanisms and functional roles. Sawtooth waves, which are exclusive to REM sleep, share many characteristics with ponto-geniculo-occipital waves described in animals and may represent the human equivalent or a closely related event, whereas medial-occipital slow waves appear similar to NREM sleep slow waves.","Bernardi, Giulio;Betta, Monica;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Pietrini, Pietro;Tononi, Giulio;Siclari, Francesca",54988409300;55904308300;8565770200;7005057128;7006294703;36764231300

With modern literature arguing against unique roles for these cortical regions, different theories have favored either neural code-sharing or cortical space-sharing, thus trying to explain the intertwined spatial and functional organization of motor and acoustic components across the fronto-temporal cortical network. In this context, the focus of attention has recently shifted toward specific model fitting, aimed at motor and/or acoustic space reconstruction in brain activity within the language network. Here, we tested a model based on acoustic properties (formants), and one based on motor properties (articulation parameters), where model-free decoding of evoked fMRI activity during perception, imagery, and production of vowels had been successful. Results revealed that phonological information organizes around formant structure during the perception of vowels; interestingly, such a model was reconstructed in a broad temporal region, outside of the primary auditory cortex, but also in the pars triangularis of the left inferior frontal gyrus. Conversely, articulatory features were not associated with brain activity in these regions.

Here, we measured the relationship between vitamin blood concentrations, scores at seventeen neuropsychological tests, and brain activity of sixty-five elders spanning from normal to Mild Cognitive Impairment. We then evaluated whether task-related brain responses represent an intermediate phenotype, providing a better prediction of subjects' neuropsychological scores, as compared to the one obtained considering blood biochemistry only. We found that the hemodynamic activity of the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex was positively associated (p value < 0 05 cluster corrected) with vitamin B12 concentrations, suggesting that elders with higher B12 levels had a more pronounced recruitment of this salience network region. Crucially, the activity of this area significantly predicted subjects' visual search and attention abilities (p value = 0 0023), whereas B12 levels per se failed to do so.

AIM: We investigated the relationship between electroencephalography (EEG)-based connectivity, the extent of brain lesions and changes in motor performance after an intensive task-oriented circuit training (TOCT). DESIGN: Observational longitudinal study. SETTING: Outpatients training program. POPULATION: Sixteen MS patients (10F; mean age =51.4 years; range: 27-67; mean disease duration =15.1 years; range: 2-26; mean Expanded Disability Status Scale 4.4; range: 3.5-5.5), were included in our study. METHODS: MS patients with mild gait impairment were evaluated through functional scales and submitted to TOCT. Resting-state EEG was performed before (TO) and after (T1) rehabilitation. Alpha-band weighted Phase Lag Index (WPLI) and broadband weighted Symbolic Mutual Information (WSMI) connectivity analyses were performed. White matter lesion load was measured using MRI prior to the TOCT. Neurophysiological and structural parameters were then related to behavioral changes. RESULTS: Dynamic Gait Index significantly improved after TOCT (F(1.14) =13.10, P=0.003). Moreover, the interaction between TOCT and age was observed for changes in Timed Up and Go (TUG) performance (F(1.14) = 7.75, P=0.015), indicating that older patients only benefited in this measure. Regarding the relationship between EEG connectivity and TOCT outcome, we observed positive correlations between changes in TUG and strength (P=0.017) and efficiency (Pone-tail =0.029) of alpha-band WPLI connectivity at T0. Such correlation was mainly driven by anteroposterior regional interactions (P=0.038), rather than by inter-hemispheric connectivity (P=0.089). Moreover, we observed a positive correlation between performance improvements and WSMI connectivity at T1 (P=0.001) as well as the difference between T0 and T1 (P=0.005). Lesion load percentage was not related to functional improvement after TOCT (Pone-tail=0.137). CONCLUSIONS: Results of the current study demonstrated that baseline alpha-band WPLI connectivity predicts TOCT outcome in MS patients. Moreover, broadband WSMI tracks neural changes that accompany treatment-related variations in motor performance. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Our findings suggest that EEG-based connectivity measures may represent a potential tool for customizing rehabilitative management of the disease.","Tramonti, Caterina;Imperatori, Laura S.;Fanciullacci, Chiara;Lamola, Giuseppe;Lettieri, Giada;Bernardi, Giulio;Cecchetti, Luca;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Chisari, Carmelo",57128438700;57209394751;6505491076;55388614800;56680972900;54988409300;56625136900;8565770200;6506235336

10.1093/cercor/bhy134,16,"Anatomo-clinical evidence from motor-awareness disorders after brain-damages suggests that the premotor cortex (PMC) is involved in motor-monitoring of voluntary actions. Indeed, PMC lesions prevent patients from detecting the mismatch between intended, but not executed, movements with the paralyzed limb. This functional magnetic resonance imaging study compared, in healthy subjects, free movements against blocked movements, precluded by a cast. Cast-related corticospinal excitability changes were investigated by using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Immediately after the immobilization, when the cast prevented the execution of left-hand movements, the contralateral right (ventral) vPMC showed both increased hemodynamic activity and increased functional connectivity with the hand area in the right somatosensory cortex, suggesting a vPMC involvement in detecting the mismatch between planned and executed movements. Crucially, after 1 week of immobilization, when the motor system had likely learned that no movement could be executed and, therefore, predictions about motor consequences were changed, vPMC did not show the enhanced activity as if no incongruence has to be detected. This can be interpreted as a consequence of the plastic changes induced by long-lasting immobilization, as also proved by the cast-related corticospinal excitability modulation in our subjects. The present findings highlight the crucial role of vPMC in the anatomo-functional network generating the human motor-awareness.","Garbarini, Francesca;Cecchetti, Luca;Bruno, Valentina;Mastropasqua, Angela;Fossataro, Carlotta;Massazza, Giuseppe;Sacco, Katiuscia;Valentini, Maria Consuelo;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Berti, Anna",6504829019;56625136900;57194764008;57188565802;55763944000;15029993300;34267607900;35611359500;8565770200;7005212707

Fourteen right-handed females took part in the study. During scanning, subjects were presented with sentences representing a detail of a highly emotional real event (positive or negative) and were asked to indicate whether the sentence described something that had or had not really happened to them. Group analysis showed a set of cortical areas able to discriminate the truthfulness of the recalled events: medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex, precuneus, bilateral angular, superior frontal gyri, and early visual cortical areas. Single-subject results showed that the decoding occurred at different time points. No differences were found between recalling a positive or a negative event.

10.1523/ENEURO.0075-18.2018,11,"One of the major challenges in visual neuroscience is represented by foreground-background segmentation. Data from nonhuman primates show that segmentation leads to two distinct, but associated processes: the enhancement of neural activity during figure processing (i.e., foreground enhancement) and the suppression of background-related activity (i.e., background suppression). To study foreground-background segmentation in ecological conditions, we introduce a novel method based on parametric modulation of low-level image properties followed by application of simple computational image-processing models. By correlating the outcome of this procedure with human fMRI activity, measured during passive viewing of 334 natural images, we produced easily interpretable “correlation images” from visual populations. Results show evidence of foreground enhancement in all tested regions, from V1 to lateral occipital complex (LOC), while background suppression occurs in V4 and LOC only. Correlation images derived from V4 and LOC revealed a preserved spatial resolution of foreground textures, indicating a richer representation of the salient part of natural images, rather than a simplistic model of object shape. Our results indicate that scene segmentation occurs during natural viewing, even when individuals are not required to perform any particular task.","Papale, Paolo;Leo, Andrea;Cecchetti, Luca;Handjaras, Giacomo;Kay, Kendrick N.;Pietrini, Pietro;Ricciardi, Emiliano",57190440455;55311312500;56625136900;35748302500;22957898800;7005057128;8565770200

Aim of the study was to assess the effects of a 7-month cognitive, social, and physical training program on cognitive and vascular function in patients with mild cognitive impairment. In a single-center, randomized, parallelgroup study, 113 patients (age, 65-89 years) were randomized to multidomain training (n=55) or usual care (n=58). All participants underwent neuropsychological tests and vascular evaluation, including brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, carotid distensibility, and assessment of circulating hematopoietic CD34+ and endothelial progenitor cells. At study entry, an age-matched control group (n=45) was also studied. Compared with controls, patients had at study entry a reduced flow-mediated dilation (2.97±2.14% versus 3.73±2.06%; P=0.03) and hyperemic stimulus (shear rate area under the curve, 19.1±15.7 versus 25.7±15.1×10-3; P=0.009); only the latter remained significant after adjustment for confounders (P=0.03). Training improved Alzheimer disease assessment scale cognitive (training, 14.0±4.8 to 13.1±5.5; nontraining, 12.1±3.9 to 13.2±4.8; P for interaction visit×training=0.02), flow-mediated dilation (2.82±2.19% to 3.40±1.81%, 3.05±2.08% to 2.24±1.59%; P=0.006; P=0.023 after adjustment for diameter and shear rate area under the curve), and circulating hematopoietic CD34+ cells and prevented the decline in carotid distensibility (18.4±5.3 to 20.0±6.6, 23.9±11.0 to 19.5±7.1 Pa-1; P=0.005). The only clinical predictor of improvement of cognitive function after training was established hypertension. There was no correlation between changes in measures of cognitive and vascular function. In conclusion, a multidomain training program slows cognitive decline, especially in hypertensive individuals. This effect is accompanied by improved systemic endothelial function, mobilization of progenitor CD34+ cells, and preserved carotid distensibility.","Bruno, Rosa Maria;Stea, Francesco;Sicari, Rosa;Ghiadoni, Lorenzo;Taddei, Stefano;Ungar, Andrea;Bonuccelli, Ubaldo;Tognoni, Gloria;Cintoli, Simona;Turco, Serena Del;Sbrana, Silverio;Gargani, Luna;D'Angelo, Gennaro;Pratali, Lorenza;Berardi, Nicoletta;Maffei, Lamberto;Picano, Eugenio;Andreassi, M.

10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2017.10.002,8,"The disembedding ability (i.e., the ability to identify a simple masked figure within a complex one) depends on attentional mechanisms, executive functions and working memory. Recent cognitive models ascribed different levels of disembedding task performance to the efficiency of the subtended mental processes engaged during visuo-spatial perception. Here we aimed at assessing whether different levels of the disembedding ability were associated to the functional signatures of neural efficiency, defined as a specific modulation in response magnitude and functional connectivity strength in task-related areas. Consequently, brain activity evoked by a visual task involving the disembedding ability was acquired using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a sample of 23 right-handed healthy individuals. Brain activity was analyzed at different levels of information processing, from local responses to connectivity interactions between brain nodes, as far as to network topological properties. All different levels of information processing were significantly modulated by individual behavioral performance. Specifically, single voxel response magnitude, connectivity strength of the right intrahemispheric and interhemispheric edges, and graph measures (i.e., local and global efficiency) were negatively associated to behavioral performance. Altogether, these results indicate that efficiency during a disembedding task cannot be merely attributed to a reduced neural recruitment of task-specific regions, but can be better characterized as an enhanced functional hemispherical asymmetry.","Danti, Sabrina;Handjaras, Giacomo;Cecchetti, Luca;Beuzeron-Mangina, Helen;Pietrini, Pietro;Ricciardi, Emiliano",56682722100;35748302500;56625136900;35078173400;7005057128;8565770200
10.1038/s41598-017-17896-9,11,"Our daily-life actions are typically driven by vision. When acting upon an object, we need to represent its visual features (e.g. shape, orientation, etc.) and to map them into our own peripersonal space. But what happens with people who have never had any visual experience? How can they map object features into their own peripersonal space? Do they do it differently from sighted agents? To tackle these questions, we carried out a series of behavioral experiments in sighted and congenitally blind subjects. We took advantage of a spatial alignment effect paradigm, which typically refers to a decrease of reaction times when subjects perform an action (e.g., a reach-To-grasp pantomime) congruent with that afforded by a presented object. To systematically examine peripersonal space mapping, we presented visual or auditory affording objects both within and outside subjects' reach. The results showed that sighted and congenitally blind subjects did not differ in mapping objects into their own peripersonal space. Strikingly, this mapping occurred also when objects were presented outside subjects' reach, but within the peripersonal space of another agent. This suggests that (the lack of) visual experience does not significantly affect the development of both one's own and others' peripersonal space representation.","Ricciardi, Emiliano;Menicagli, Dario;Leo, Andrea;Costantini, Marcello;Pietrini, Pietro;Sinigaglia, Corrado",8565770200;57199647974;55311312500;7102942941;7005057128;25652497800

Nonetheless, neuropsychological, structural and functional studies have questioned such subdivision, suggesting an interwoven organization of the speech function within these cortices. We tested whether sub-regions within frontal and temporal speech-related areas retain specific phonological representations during both perception and production. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and multivoxel pattern analysis, we showed functional and spatial segregation across the left fronto-temporal cortex during listening, imagery and production of vowels. In accordance with classical models of language and evidence from functional studies, the inferior frontal and superior temporal cortices discriminated among perceived and produced vowels respectively, also engaging in the non-classical, alternative function - i.e. perception in the inferior frontal and production in the superior temporal cortex. Crucially, though, contiguous and non-overlapping sub-regions within these hubs performed either the classical or non-classical function, the latter also representing non-linguistic sounds (i.e., pure tones). Extending previous results and in line with integration theories, our findings not only demonstrate that sensitivity to speech listening exists in production-related regions and vice versa, but they also suggest that the nature of such interwoven organisation is built upon low-level perception.","Rampinini, Alessandra Cecilia;Handjaras, Giacomo;Leo, Andrea;Cecchetti, Luca;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Marotta, Giovanna;Pietrini, Pietro",57190443337;35748302500;55311312500;56625136900;8565770200;55951413200;7005057128
10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.05.001,19,"The organization of semantic information in the brain has been mainly explored through category-based models, on the assumption that categories broadly reflect the organization of conceptual knowledge. However, the analysis of concepts as individual entities, rather than as items belonging to distinct superordinate categories, may represent a significant advancement in the comprehension of how conceptual knowledge is encoded in the human brain. Here, we studied the individual representation of thirty concrete nouns from six different categories, across different sensory modalities (i.e., auditory and visual) and groups (i.e., sighted and congenitally blind individuals) in a core hub of the semantic network, the left angular gyrus, and in its neighboring regions within the lateral parietal cortex. Four models based on either perceptual or semantic features at different levels of complexity (i.e., low- or high-level) were used to predict fMRI brain activity using representational similarity encoding analysis. When controlling for the superordinate component, high-level models based on semantic and shape information led to significant encoding accuracies in the intraparietal sulcus only. This region is involved in feature binding and combination of concepts across multiple sensory modalities, suggesting its role in high-level representation of conceptual knowledge. Moreover, when the information regarding superordinate categories is retained, a large extent of parietal cortex is engaged. This result indicates the need to control for the coarse-level categorial organization when performing studies on higher-level processes related to the retrieval of semantic information.","Handjaras, Giacomo;Leo, Andrea;Cecchetti, Luca;Papale, Paolo;Lenci, Alessandro;Marotta, Giovanna;Pietrini, Pietro;Ricciardi, Emiliano",35748302500;55311312500;56625136900;57190440455;8286541500;55951413200;7005057128;8565770200

To this extent, HRV signals were gathered from 32 subjects during an isometric contraction task, and features defined in the time, frequency and nonlinear domains were investigated.

Statistically significant differences were observed by comparing features related to fatigued subjects with the non-fatigued ones.

In this paper we present a description of a novel magnetic compatible supernumerary robotic finger together with preliminary observations from two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, in which brain activity was measured before and after a period of training with the robotic device, and during the use of the novel MRI-compatible version of the supernumerary robotic finger. Results showed that the usage of the MR-compatible robotic finger is safe and does not produce artifacts on MRI images.

10.1016/j.bbr.2017.03.031,19,"Introduction Neuroticism is a complex personality trait encompassing diverse aspects. Notably, high levels of neuroticism are related to the onset of psychiatric conditions, including anxiety and mood disorders. Personality traits are stable individual features; therefore, they can be expected to be associated with stable neurobiological features, including the Brain Resting State (RS) activity as measured by fMRI. Several metrics have been used to describe RS properties, yielding rather inconsistent results. This inconsistency could be due to the fact that different metrics portray different RS signal properties and that these properties may be differently affected by neuroticism. To explore the distinct effects of neuroticism, we assessed several distinct metrics portraying different RS properties within the same population. Method Neuroticism was measured in 31 healthy subjects using the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire; RS was acquired by high-resolution fMRI. Using linear regression, we examined the modulatory effects of neuroticism on RS activity, as quantified by the Amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF, fALFF), regional homogeneity (REHO), Hurst Exponent (H), global connectivity (GC) and amygdalae functional connectivity. Results Neuroticism modulated the different metrics across a wide network of brain regions, including emotional regulatory, default mode and visual networks. Except for some similarities in key brain regions for emotional expression and regulation, neuroticism affected different metrics in different ways. Discussion Metrics more related to the measurement of regional intrinsic brain activity (fALFF, ALFF and REHO), or that provide a parsimonious index of integrated and segregated brain activity (HE), were more broadly modulated in regions related to emotions and their regulation. Metrics related to connectivity were modulated across a wider network of areas. Overall, these results show that neuroticism affects distinct aspects of brain resting state activity. More in general, these findings indicate that a multiparametric approach may be required to obtain a more detailed characterization of the neural underpinnings of a given psychological trait.","Gentili, Claudio;Cristea, Ioana Alina;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Vanello, Nicola;Popita, Cristian;David, Daniel;Pietrini, Pietro",13204290200;25642340700;8565770200;6505734003;57193350571;7202770192;7005057128

,1,"In the last thirty years, in vivo brain structural and functional exploration has sparked vivid light on the neural correlates of language. Along these lines, the study of phonological competence has offered a 'neural view' into the organization of basic speechsensitive areas, improving the sensitivity of pre-surgical mapping and brain-computer interface-based communication. Nevertheless, only rarely the significance of these results has been recognized in the context of a century-long discussion around the theoretical, physical and cognitive consistency of the phoneme itself. Here we review recent investigations into speech perception, imagery and production at the segmental level through neuroimaging and neurophysiological techniques, showing that phonemes are processed as discrete entities, which are categorized in cognition as unique products of their acoustic and articulatory features, despite the seamless flow of the speech signal. These results seem to expand the scope of the motor theory of speech perception.","Rampinini, Alessandra;Ricciardi, Emiliano",57190443337;8565770200

Only more recently, scientists have developed innovative strategies to understand to what extent vision is truly a mandatory prerequisite for the brain’s fine morphological architecture to develop and function. As a whole, the studies conducted to date in sighted and congenitally blind individuals have provided ample evidence that several ""visual"" cortical areas develop independently from visual experience and do process information content regardless of the sensory modality through which a particular stimulus is conveyed: a property named supramodality. At the same time, lack of vision leads to a structural and functional reorganization within ""visual"" brain areas, a phenomenon known as cross-modal plasticity. Cross-modal recruitment of the occipital cortex in visually deprived individuals represents an adaptative compensatory mechanism that mediates processing of non-visual inputs. Supramodality and cross-modal plasticity appears to be the ""yin and yang"" of brain development: supramodal is what takes place despite the lack of vision, whereas cross-modal is what happens because of lack of vision. Here we provide a critical overview of the research in this field and discuss the implications that these novel findings have for the development of educative/rehabilitation approaches and sensory substitution devices (SSDs) in sensory-impaired individuals.","Cecchetti, Luca;Kupers, Ron;Ptito, Maurice;Pietrini, Pietro;Ricciardi, Emiliano",56625136900;7003484370;7005537267;7005057128;8565770200

To address the differential role of low-level sensory-based and high-level abstract features in semantic processing, we combined behavioral studies of linguistic production and brain activity measures by functional magnetic resonance imaging in sighted and congenitally blind individuals while they performed a property-generation task with concrete nouns from eight categories, presented through visual and/or auditory modalities.Patterns of neural activity within a large semantic cortical network that comprised parahippocampal, lateral occipital, temporo-parieto-occipital and inferior parietal cortices correlated with linguistic production and were independent both from the modality of stimulus presentation (either visual or auditory) and the (lack of) visual experience. In contrast, selected modality-dependent differences were observed only when the analysis was limited to the individual regions within the semantic cortical network.We conclude that conceptual knowledge in the human brain relies on a distributed, modality-independent cortical representation that integrates the partial category and modality specific information retained at a regional level.","Handjaras, Giacomo;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Leo, Andrea;Lenci, Alessandro;Cecchetti, Luca;Cosottini, Mirco;Marotta, Giovanna;Pietrini, Pietro",35748302500;8565770200;55311312500;8286541500;56625136900;55999935600;55951413200;7005057128

At the same time, novel insights from cognitive neuroscience research have begun to influence various disciplines, leading to a turn to cognition and emotion in the fields of planning and architectural design. Since 2003, the Academy of Neuroscience for Architecture has been supporting 'neuro-architecture' as a way to connect neuroscience and the study of behavioral responses to the built environment. Among the many topics related to multisensory perceptual integration and embodiment, the concept of hapticity was recently introduced, suggesting a pivotal role of tactile perception and haptic imagery in architectural appraisal. Arguments have thus risen in favor of the existence of shared cognitive foundations between hapticity and the supramodal functional architecture of the human brain. Precisely, supramodality refers to the functional feature of defined brain regions to process and represent specific information content in a more abstract way, independently of the sensory modality conveying such information to the brain. Here, we highlight some commonalities and differences between the concepts of hapticity and supramodality according to the distinctive perspectives of architecture and cognitive neuroscience. This comparison and connection between these two different approaches may lead to novel observations in regard to people-environment relationships, and even provide empirical foundations for a renewed evidence-based design theory.","Papale, Paolo;Chiesi, Leonardo;Rampinini, Alessandra C.;Pietrini, Pietro;Ricciardi, Emiliano",57190440455;56694950200;57190443337;7005057128;8565770200

However, the diagnostic value of this technique is still debated because of the lack of accuracy in determining levels of consciousness within a single patient. Recently, Giacino and colleagues (2014) hypothesized that a longitudinal fMRI evaluation may provide a more informative assessment in the detection of residual awareness. The aim of this study was to measure the correspondence between clinically defined level of awareness and neural responses within a single DOC patient. Methods: We used a follow-up fMRI design in combination with a passive speech-processing task. Patient's consciousness was measured through time by using the Coma Recovery Scale. Results: The patient progressed from a vegetative state (VS) to a minimally conscious state (MCS). Patient's task-related neural responses mirrored the clinical change from a VS to an MCS. Specifically, while in an MCS, but not a VS, the patient showed a selective recruitment of the left angular gyrus when he listened to a native speech narrative, as compared to the reverse presentation of the same stimulus. Furthermore, the patient showed an increased response in the language-related brain network and a greater deactivation in the default mode network following his progression to an MCS. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that longitudinal assessment of brain responses to passive stimuli can contribute to the definition of the clinical status in individual patients with DOC and represents an adequate counterpart of the bedside assessment during the diagnostic decision-making process.

Do these changes continue to accumulate if task training continues, and can they be reverted by sleep? We addressed these questions by combining structural and diffusion weighted MRI and high-density EEG in 16 subjects studied during the physiological sleep/wake cycle, after 12 h and 24 h of intense practice in two different tasks, and after post-training sleep. Compared to baseline wake, 12 h of training led to a decline in cortical mean diffusivity. The decrease became even more significant after 24 h of task practice combined with sleep deprivation. Prolonged practice also resulted in decreased ventricular volume and increased GM and WM subcortical volumes. All changes reverted after recovery sleep. Moreover, these structural alterations predicted cognitive performance at the individual level, suggesting that sleep's ability to counteract performance deficits is linked to its effects on the brain microstructure. The cellular mechanisms that account for the structural effects of sleep are unknown, but they may be linked to its role in promoting the production of cerebrospinal fluid and the decrease in synapse size and strength, as well as to its recently discovered ability to enhance the extracellular space and the clearance of brain metabolites.","Bernardi, Giulio;Cecchetti, Luca;Siclari, Francesca;Buchmann, Andreas;Yu, Xiaoqian;Handjaras, Giacomo;Bellesi, Michele;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Kecskemeti, Steven R.;Riedner, Brady A.;Alexander, Andrew L.;Benca, Ruth M.;Ghilardi, M.

Therefore, in the present multicenter study, we used MRI to measure volume of the superior and inferior colliculi, as well as of the thalamic nuclei relaying sensory and motor information to the neocortex, parcellated according to atlas-based thalamo-cortical connections, in 29 individuals with congenital blindness of peripheral origin (17 M, age 35.7 ± 14.3 years) and 29 sighted subjects (17 M, age 31.9 ± 9.0). Blind participants showed an overall volume reduction in the left (p = 0.008) and right (p = 0.007) thalami, as compared to the sighted individuals. Specifically, the lateral geniculate (i.e., primary visual thalamic relay nucleus) was 40 % reduced (left: p = 4 × 10−6, right: p < 1 × 10−6), consistent with findings from animal studies. In addition, associated thalamic nuclei that project to temporal (left: p = 0.005, right: p = 0.005), prefrontal (left: p = 0.010, right: p = 0.014), occipital (left: p = 0.005, right: p = 0.023), and right premotor (p = 0.024) cortical regions were also significantly reduced in the congenitally blind group. Conversely, volumes of the relay nuclei directly involved in auditory, motor, and somatosensory processing were not affected by visual deprivation. In contrast, no difference in volume was observed in either the superior or the inferior colliculus between the two groups. Our findings indicate that visual loss since birth leads to selective volumetric changes within diencephalic, but not mesencephalic, structures. Both changes in reciprocal cortico-thalamic connections or modifications in the intrinsic connectivity between relay and association nuclei of the thalamus may contribute to explain these alterations in thalamic volumes. Sparing of the superior colliculi is in line with their composite, multisensory projections, and with their not exclusive visual nature.","Cecchetti, Luca;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Handjaras, Giacomo;Kupers, Ron;Ptito, Maurice;Pietrini, Pietro",56625136900;8565770200;35748302500;7003484370;7005537267;7005057128

The concept of synergy has been proposed to indicate functional modules that may simplify the control of hand postures by simultaneously recruiting sets of muscles and joints. However, whether and to what extent synergic hand postures are encoded as such at a cortical level remains unknown. Here, we combined kinematic, electromyography, and brain activity measures obtained by functional magnetic resonance imaging while subjects performed a variety of movements towards virtual objects. Hand postural information, encoded through kinematic synergies, were represented in cortical areas devoted to hand motor control and successfully discriminated individual grasping movements, significantly outperforming alternative somatotopic or muscle-based models. Importantly, hand postural synergies were predicted by neural activation patterns within primary motor cortex.

In this work, a method based on hierarchical clustering of ICA applied to fMRI datasets is investigated. The clustering algorithm uses a metric based on the mutual information between the ICs. To estimate the similarity measure, a histogram-based technique and one based on kernel density estimation are tested on simulated datasets. Simulations results indicate that the method could be used to cluster components related to the same task and resulting from a splitting process occurring at different model orders.

Previous models proposed the distinct features of a motor act to be hierarchically organized in separated, but functionally interconnected, cortical areas. Here, we hypothesized that distinct patterns across a wide expanse of cortex may actually subserve a topographically organized coding of different categories of actions that represents, at a higher cognitive level and independently from the distinct motor features, the action and its final aim as a whole. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and pattern classification approaches on the neural responses of 14 right-handed individuals passively watching short movies of hand-performed tool-mediated, transitive, and meaningful intransitive actions, we were able to discriminate with a high accuracy and characterize the category-specific response patterns. Actions are distinctively coded in distributed and overlapping neural responses within an action-selective network, comprising frontal, parietal, lateral occipital and ventrotemporal regions. This functional organization, that we named action topography, subserves a higher-level and more abstract representation of finalized actions and has the capacity to provide unique representations for multiple categories of actions.","Handjaras, Giacomo;Bernardi, Giulio;Benuzzi, Francesca;Nichelli, Paolo F.;Pietrini, Pietro;Ricciardi, Emiliano",35748302500;54988409300;6602925063;7005740633;7005057128;8565770200

Subjects completed the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) and the Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation (BFNE) to assess social anxiety and thoughts in social contexts. We also obtained the fractional Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuations (fALFF) of the BOLD signal as an independent control measure for HE data. BFNE scores correlated positively with HE in the posterior cingulate/precuneus, while LSAS scores correlated positively with HE in the precuneus, in the inferior parietal sulci and in the parahippocamus. Results from fALFF were highly consistent with those obtained using LSAS and BFNE to predict HE.

10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2015.01.004,22,"Although vision offers distinctive information to space representation, individuals who lack vision since birth often show perceptual and representational skills comparable to those found in sighted individuals. However, congenitally blind individuals may result in impaired spatial analysis, when engaging in 'visual' spatial features (e.g., perspective or angle representation) or complex spatial mental abilities. In the present study, we measured behavioral and brain responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging in sighted and congenitally blind individuals during spatial imagery based on a modified version of the mental clock task (e.g., angle discrimination) and a simple recognition control condition, as conveyed across distinct sensory modalities: visual (sighted individuals only), tactile and auditory. Blind individuals were significantly less accurate during the auditory task, but comparable-to-sighted during the tactile task. As expected, both groups showed common neural activations in intraparietal and superior parietal regions across visual and non-visual spatial perception and imagery conditions, indicating the more abstract, sensory independent functional organization of these cortical areas, a property that we named supramodality. At the same time, however, comparisons in brain responses and functional connectivity patterns across experimental conditions demonstrated also a functional lateralization, in a way that correlated with the distinct behavioral performance in blind and sighted individuals. Specifically, blind individuals relied more on right parietal regions, mainly in the tactile and less in the auditory spatial processing. In sighted, spatial representation across modalities relied more on left parietal regions. In conclusions, intraparietal and superior parietal regions subserve supramodal spatial representations in sighted and congenitally blind individuals.

10.1016/j.neuroscience.2014.10.042,13,"The main visual pathway that conveys motion information to the middle temporal complex (hMT+) originates from the primary visual cortex (V1), which, in turn, receives spatial and temporal features of the perceived stimuli from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). In addition, visual motion information reaches hMT+ directly from the thalamus, bypassing the V1, through a direct pathway. We aimed at elucidating whether this direct route between LGN and hMT+ represents a 'fast lane' reserved to high-speed motion, as proposed previously, or it is merely involved in processing motion information irrespective of speeds. We evaluated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses elicited by moving visual stimuli and applied connectivity analyses to investigate the effect of motion speed on the causal influence between LGN and hMT+, independent of V1, using the Conditional Granger Causality (CGC) in the presence of slow and fast visual stimuli. Our results showed that at least part of the visual motion information from LGN reaches hMT+, bypassing V1, in response to both slow and fast motion speeds of the perceived stimuli. We also investigated whether motion speeds have different effects on the connections between LGN and functional subdivisions within hMT+: direct connections between LGN and MT-proper carry mainly slow motion information, while connections between LGN and MST carry mainly fast motion information. The existence of a parallel pathway that connects the LGN directly to hMT+ in response to both slow and fast speeds may explain why MT and MST can still respond in the presence of V1 lesions.","Gaglianese, A.;Costagli, M.;Ueno, K.;Ricciardi, E.;Bernardi, G.;Pietrini, P.;Cheng, K.",54986210200;22333629800;55505343900;8565770200;54988409300;7005057128;7402998250

In awake rats, the occurrence of an OFF period in a brain area relevant for behavior results in performance errors. Here we investigated the potential relationship between local sleep events and negative behavioral outcomes in humans. Volunteers participated in two prolonged wakefulness experiments (24 h), each including 12 h of practice with either a driving simulation (DS) game or a battery of tasks based on executive functions (EFs). Multiple high-density EEG recordings were obtained during each experiment, both in quiet rest conditions and during execution of two behavioral tests, a response inhibition test and a motor test, aimed at assessing changes in impulse control and visuomotor performance, respectively. In addition, fMRI examinations obtained at 12 h intervals were used to investigate changes in inter-regional connectivity. The EF experiment was associated with a reduced efficiency in impulse control, whereas DS led to a relative impairment in visuomotor control. A specific spatial and temporal correlation was observed between EEG theta waves occurring in task-related areas and deterioration of behavioral performance. The fMRI connectivity analysis indicated that performance impairment might partially depend on a breakdown in connectivity determined by a “network overload.” Present results demonstrate the existence of an association between theta waves during wakefulness and performance errors and may contribute explaining behavioral impairments under conditions of sleep deprivation/restriction.","Bernardi, Giulio;Siclari, Francesca;Yu, Xiaoqian;Zennig, Corinna;Bellesi, Michele;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Cirelli, Chiara;Ghilardi, Maria Felice;Pietrini, Pietro;Tononi, Giulio",54988409300;36764231300;57200600764;55842709800;7801530324;8565770200;7003312242;7004106833;7005057128;7006294703

In this brief review, we discuss the main findings from a series of brain anatomical and functional studies conducted in sighted and congenitally blind individuals by our’s and others' laboratories. Historically, research on the ‘blind brain’ has focused mainly on the cross-modal plastic changes that follow sensory deprivation. More recently, a novel line of research has been developed to determine to what extent visual experience is truly required to achieve a representation of the surrounding environment. Overall, the results of these studies indicate that most of the brain fine morphological and functional architecture is programmed to develop and function independently from any visual experience. Distinct cortical areas are able to process information in a supramodal fashion, that is, independently from the sensory modality that carries that information to the brain. These observations strongly support the hypothesis of a modality-independent, i.e. more abstract, cortical organization, and may contribute to explain how congenitally blind individuals may interact efficiently with an external world that they have never seen.","Ricciardi, Emiliano;Handjaras, Giacomo;Pietrini, Pietro",8565770200;35748302500;7005057128

Subjects were presented with short movies depicting a Formula One car racing in four different official circuits. Brain activity was assessed in terms of regional response, using an Inter-Subject Correlation (ISC) approach, and regional interactions by mean of functional connectivity. In addition, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to identify specific structural differences between the two groups and potential interactions with functional differences detected by the ISC analysis. Relative to non-experienced drivers, professional drivers showed a more consistent recruitment of motor control and spatial navigation devoted areas, including premotor/motor cortex, striatum, anterior, and posterior cingulate cortex and retrosplenial cortex, precuneus, middle temporal cortex, and parahippocampus. Moreover, some of these brain regions, including the retrosplenial cortex, also had an increased gray matter density in professional car drivers. Furthermore, the retrosplenial cortex, which has been previously associated with the storage of observer-independent spatial maps, revealed a specific correlation with the individual driver's success in official competitions.

Our approach revealed a specific functional cortical segregation according to the sensory modality conveying the non-visual information, irrespectively from the cognitive features of the tasks. In particular, dorsal and posterior subregions of occipital and superior parietal cortex showed a higher cross-modal recruitment across tactile tasks in blind as compared to sighted individuals. On the other hand, auditory stimuli activated more medial and ventral clusters within early visual areas, the lingual and inferior temporal cortex.

Compared to the sighted controls, congenitally blind individuals showed a 12% reduction in the splenium, and a 20% increase in the isthmus and the posterior part of the body. A shape analysis further revealed that the bending angle of the corpus callosum was more convex in congenitally blind compared to the sighted control subjects. The observed morphometric changes in the corpus callosum are in line with the well-described cross-modal functional and structural neuroplastic changes in congenital blindness.","Tomaiuolo, Francesco;Campana, Serena;Collins, D.

Here we review work from our lab and others, conducted in sighted and congenitally blind individuals, whose results indicate that vision is not a mandatory prerequisite for the brain cortical organization to develop and function. Similar cortical networks subtend visual and/or non-visual perception of form, space and movement, as well as action recognition, both in sighted and in congenitally blind individuals. These findings support the hypothesis of a modality independent, supramodal cortical organization. Visual experience, however, does play a role in shaping specific cortical sub-regions, as loss of sight is accompanied also by cross-modal plastic phenomena.

10.1093/cercor/bhs294,20,"How does our brain detect changes in a natural scene? While changes by increments of specific visual attributes, such as contrast or motion coherence, can be signaled by an increase in neuronal activity in early visual areas, like the primary visual cortex (V1) or the human middle temporal complex (hMT+), respectively, the mechanisms for signaling changes resulting from decrements in a stimulus attribute are largely unknown. We have discovered opposing patterns of cortical responses to changes in motion coherence: unlike areas hMT+, V3A and parieto-occipital complex (V6+) that respond to changes in the level of motion coherence monotonically, human areas V4 (hV4), V3B, and ventral occipital always respond positively to both transient increments and decrements. This pattern of responding always positively to stimulus changes can emerge in the presence of either coherence-selective neuron populations, or neurons that are not tuned to particular coherences but adapt to a particular coherence level in a stimulus-selective manner. Our findings provide evidence that these areas possess physiological properties suited for signaling increments and decrements in a stimulus and may form a part of cortical vigilance system for detecting salient changes in the environment. © The Author 2012.","Costagli, Mauro;Ueno, Kenichi;Sun, Pei;Gardner, Justin L.;Wan, Xiaohong;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Pietrini, Pietro;Tanaka, Keiji;Cheng, Kang",22333629800;55505343900;36060529200;7403051679;12766602600;8565770200;7005057128;57203333215;7402998250

In response to painful emotions, individuals may react with anger, hostility, and the desire for revenge. As an alternative, they may decide to forgive the wrongdoer and relinquish resentment. In the present study, we examined the brain correlates of forgiveness using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Healthy participants were induced to imagine social scenarios that described emotionally hurtful events followed by the indication to either forgive the imagined offenders, or harbor a grudge toward them. Subjects rated their imaginative skills, levels of anger, frustration, and/or relief when imagining negative events as well as following forgiveness. Forgiveness was associated with positive emotional states as compared to unforgiveness. Granting forgiveness was associated with activations in a brain network involved in theory of mind, empathy, and the regulation of affect through cognition, which comprised the precuneus, right inferior parietal regions, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Our results uncovered the neuronal basis of reappraisal-driven forgiveness, and extend extant data on emotional regulation to the resolution of anger and resentment following negative interpersonal events.","Ricciardi, Emiliano;Rota, Giuseppina;Sani, Lorenzo;Gentili, Claudio;Gaglianese, Anna;Guazzelli, Mario;Pietrini, Pietro",8565770200;23482592800;21735510400;13204290200;54986210200;16405674800;7005057128

By using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we measured brain activity while eleven Formula racing-car drivers and eleven 'naïve' volunteers performed a motor reaction and a visuo-spatial task. Tasks were set at a relatively low level of difficulty such to ensure a similar performance in the two groups and thus avoid any potential confounding effects on brain activity due to discrepancies in task execution. The brain functional organization was analyzed in terms of regional brain response, inter-regional interactions and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal variability. While performance levels were equal in the two groups, as compared to naïve drivers, professional drivers showed a smaller volume recruitment of task-related regions, stronger connections among task-related areas, and an increased information integration as reflected by a higher signal temporal variability. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that, as compared to naïve subjects, the brain functional architecture sustaining visuo-motor processing in professional racing-car drivers, trained to perform at the highest levels under extremely demanding conditions, undergoes both 'quantitative' and 'qualitative' modifications that are evident even when the brain is engaged in relatively simple, non-demanding tasks.

10.1177/1535370213497326,8,"Potentiation of cholinergic transmission influences stimulus processing by enhancing signal detection through suppression and/or filtering out of irrelevant information (bottom-up modulation) and with top-down task-oriented executive mechanisms based on the recruitment of prefrontal and parietal attentional systems. The cholinergic system also plays a critical role in working memory (WM) processes and preferentially modulates WM encoding, likely through stimulus-processing mechanisms. Previous research reported increased brain responses in visual extrastriate cortical regions during cholinergic enhancement in the encoding phase of WM, independently addressing object and spatial encoding. The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine the effects of cholinergic enhancement on encoding of key visual processing features. Subjects participated in two scanning sessions, one during an intravenous (i.v.) infusion of saline and the other during an infusion of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine. In each scan session, subjects alternated between a face identity recognition and a spatial location WM. Enhanced cholinergic function increased neural activity in the ventral stream during encoding of face identity and in the dorsal stream during encoding of face location. Conversely, a reduction in brain response was found for scrambled sensorimotor control images. The cholinergic effects on neural activity in the ventral stream during encoding of face identity were stronger than those observed in the dorsal stream during encoding of face location, likely as a consequence of the role of acetylcholine in establishing the inherently relevant nature of face identity. Despite the limited sample-size, the results suggest the stimulus-dependent role of cholinergic system in signal detection, as they show that cholinergic potentiation enhances neural activity in regions associated with early perceptual processing in a selective manner depending on the attended stimulus feature. © 2013 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.","Handjaras, Giacomo;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Szczepanik, Joanna;Pietrini, Pietro;Furey, Maura L.",35748302500;8565770200;8778635000;7005057128;7004873460

However, it is yet unclear how the peripersonal space is encoded and remapped depending on the availability of visual feedback and on the target position within the individual's reachable space, and which cerebral areas subserve such processes. Here, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine neural activity while healthy young participants performed reach-to-grasp movements with and without visual feedback and at different distances of the target from the effector (near to the hand-about 15 cm from the starting position-vs. far from the hand-about 30 cm from the starting position). Brain response in the superior parietal lobule bilaterally, in the right dorsal premotor cortex, and in the anterior part of the right inferior parietal lobule was significantly greater during visually-guided grasping of targets located at the far distance compared to grasping of targets located near to the hand. In the absence of visual feedback, the inferior parietal lobule exhibited a greater activity during grasping of targets at the near compared to the far distance. Results suggest that in the presence of visual feedback, a visuo-motor circuit integrates visuo-motor information when targets are located farther away.

Furthermore, recent findings indicate that the action-observation network encodes not merely the observed motor act, but rather a representation that is independent from a specific sensory modality or sensory experience. In the present study, we wished to determine to what extent this distributed and 'more abstract' representation of action is truly supramodal, i.e. shares a common coding across sensory modalities. To this aim, a pattern recognition approach was employed to analyze neural responses in sighted and congenitally blind subjects during visual and/or auditory presentation of hand-made actions. Multivoxel pattern analyses-based classifiers discriminated action from non-action stimuli across sensory conditions (visual and auditory) and experimental groups (blind and sighted). Moreover, these classifiers labeled as 'action' the pattern of neural responses evoked during actual motor execution. Interestingly, discriminative information for the action/non action classification was located in a bilateral, but left-prevalent, network that strongly overlaps with brain regions known to form the action-observation network and the human mirror system. The ability to identify action features with a multivoxel pattern analyses-based classifier in both sighted and blind individuals and independently from the sensory modality conveying the stimuli clearly supports the hypothesis of a supramodal, distributed functional representation of actions, mainly within the action-observation network. © 2013 Ricciardi et al.","Ricciardi, Emiliano;Handjaras, Giacomo;Bonino, Daniela;Vecchi, Tomaso;Fadiga, Luciano;Pietrini, Pietro",8565770200;35748302500;24376198000;6603719753;6603680863;7005057128

We also assessed detection thresholds for innocuous warmth and cold, and participants' attitude toward painful encounters in daily life. Our results show that, compared to sighted subjects, congenitally blind subjects have lower heat pain thresholds, rate suprathreshold heat pain stimuli as more painful, and have increased sensitivity for cold pain stimuli. Thresholds for nonpainful thermal stimulation did not differ between groups. The results of the pain questionnaires further indicated that blind subjects are more attentive to signals of external threats.

We have hypothesized that the changes in neural activity observed during increased cholinergic function reflect an increase in neural efficiency that leads to improved task performance. The current study tested this hypothesis by assessing neural efficiency based on cholinergically-mediated effects on regional brain connectivity and BOLD signal variability. Nine subjects participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover fMRI study. Following an infusion of physostigmine (1 mg/h) or placebo, echo-planar imaging (EPI) was conducted as participants performed a selective attention task. During the task, two images comprised of superimposed pictures of faces and houses were presented. Subjects were instructed periodically to shift their attention from one stimulus component to the other and to perform a matching task using hand held response buttons. A control condition included phase-scrambled images of superimposed faces and houses that were presented in the same temporal and spatial manner as the attention task; participants were instructed to perform a matching task. Cholinergic enhancement improved performance during the selective attention task, with no change during the control task. Functional connectivity analyses showed that the strength of connectivity between ventral visual processing areas and task-related occipital, parietal and prefrontal regions reduced significantly during cholinergic enhancement, exclusively during the selective attention task. Physostigmine administration also reduced BOLD signal temporal variability relative to placebo throughout temporal and occipital visual processing areas, again during the selective attention task only. Together with the observed behavioral improvement, the decreases in connectivity strength throughout task-relevant regions and BOLD variability within stimulus processing regions support the hypothesis that cholinergic augmentation results in enhanced neural efficiency.

In the present study, we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to assess whether hMT+ plays a causal role in tactile motion processing. Blindfolded participants detected changes in the speed of a grid of tactilemoving points with their finger (i.e. tactile modality). The experiment included three different conditions: a control condition with no TMS and two TMS conditions, i.e. hMT+-rTMS and posterior parietal cortex (PPC)-rTMS. Accuracies were significantly impaired during hMT+-rTMS but not in the other two conditions (No-rTMS or PPC-rTMS), moreover, thresholds for detecting speed changes were significantly higher in the hMT+-rTMS with respect to the control TMS conditions.

We then investigated whether regional activations underlying tactile shape discrimination depended on the reliability of visual shape. Indeed, in primary somatosensory cortices (bilateral BA2) and the superior parietal lobe the responses to tactile shape input were increased when the reliability of visual shape information was reduced. Conversely, tactile inputs suppressed visual activations in the right posterior fusiform gyrus, when the visual signal was blurred and unreliable.

10.1155/2012/720278,41,"Previous studies in early blind individuals posited a possible role of parieto-occipital connections in conveying nonvisual information to the visual occipital cortex. As a consequence of blindness, parietal areas would thus become able to integrate a greater amount of multimodal information than in sighted individuals. To verify this hypothesis, we compared fMRI-measured BOLD signal temporal variability, an index of efficiency in functional information integration, in congenitally blind and sighted individuals during tactile spatial discrimination and motion perception tasks. In both tasks, the BOLD variability analysis revealed many cortical regions with a significantly greater variability in the blind as compared to sighted individuals, with an overlapping cluster located in the left inferior parietal/anterior intraparietal cortex. A functional connectivity analysis using this region as seed showed stronger correlations in both tasks with occipital areas in the blind as compared to sighted individuals. As BOLD variability reflects neural integration and processing efficiency, these cross-modal plastic changes in the parietal cortex, even if described in a limited sample, reinforce the hypothesis that this region may play an important role in processing nonvisual information in blind subjects and act as a hub in the cortico-cortical pathway from somatosensory cortex to the reorganized occipital areas.

The present work aimed to break down metaphor comprehension into its functional components. The study rationale is two-fold: on the one hand, the large-scale network model as emerging in cognitive neuroscience led us to a consideration of metaphor as supported by a distributed and bilateral network; on the other hand, we based on the accounts of figurative language put forward in pragmatics and cognitive science to postulate a decomposition of such a network into multiple sub-systems. During scanning, participants implicitly processed metaphorical (familiar and unfamiliar) and non-metaphorical passages, while being explicitly involved in an adjective matching task to be performed after reading the target passages. Several regions showed greater activity to metaphors as compared to non-metaphors, including left and right inferior frontal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, left angular gyrus, and anterior cingulate. This pattern of activations, markedly bilateral, can be decomposed into circumscribed functional sub-systems mediating different aspects of metaphor resolution, as foreseen in the pragmatic and cognitive literature: (a) the conceptual/pragmatic machinery in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus and in the left angular gyrus, which supports the integration of linguistic material and world knowledge in context; (b) the attentional component in the anterior cingulate and prefrontal areas, which is set to monitor and filter for the relevant aspects of context and for the appropriate meanings; (c) the Theory of Mind system along the right superior temporal sulcus, which deals with the recognition of speakers' communicative intentions and is more extensively activated by unfamiliar metaphors.

Findings from structural and functional brain studies in both sighted and congenitally blind individuals have shown the existence of supramodal brain regions able to process external information regardless of the sensory modality through which such an information has been acquired. This more abstract nature of functional cortical organization may enable congenitally blind individuals to acquire knowledge, form mental representations of and interact effectively with an external world that they have never seen. Summary: Altogether, findings from both behavioural and imaging studies indicate that the brain functional organization is to a large extent independent from visual experience and able to process information in a supramodal fashion.

10.3389/fnsys.2010.00159,38,"Human middle temporal complex (hMT+) responds also to the perception of non-visual motion in both sighted and early blind individuals, indicating a supramodal organization. Visual experience, however, leads to a segregation of hMT+ into a more anterior subregion, involved in the supramodal representation of motion, and a posterior subregion that processes visual motion only. In contrast, in congenitally blind subjects tactile motion activates the full extent of hMT+. Here, we used fMRI to investigate brain areas functionally connected with the two hMT+ subregions (seeds) during visual and tactile motion in sighted and blind individuals. A common functional connectivity network for motion processing, including bilateral ventral and dorsal extrastriate, inferior frontal, middle and inferior temporal areas, correlated with the two hMT+ seeds both in sighted and blind individuals during either visual or tactile motion, independently from the sensory modality through which the information was acquired. Moreover, ventral premotor, somatosensory, and posterior parietal areas correlated only with the anterior but not with the posterior portion of hMT+ in sighted subjects, and with both hMT+ seeds in blind subjects. Furthermore, a correlation between middle temporal and occipital areas with primary somatosensory seeds was demonstrated across conditions in both sighted and blind individuals, suggesting a cortico-cortical pathway that conveys non-visual information from somatosensory cortex, through posterior parietal regions, to ventral extrastriate cortex. These findings expand our knowledge about the development of the functional organization within hMT+ by showing that distinct patterns of brain functional correlations originate from the anterior and posterior hMT+ subregions as a result of visual experience. © 2010 Sani, Ricciardi, Gentili, Vanello, Haxby and Pietrini.","Sani, Lorenzo;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Gentili, Claudio;Vanello, Nicola;Haxby, James V.;Pietrini, Pietro",21735510400;8565770200;13204290200;6505734003;7004857212;7005057128
10.3389/fnsys.2010.00152,33,"Recently, a differential recruitment of brain areas throughout the distributed neural system for face perception has been found in social phobic patients as compared to healthy control subjects. These functional abnormalities in social phobic patients extend beyond emotion-related brain areas, such as the amygdala, to include cortical networks that modulate attention and process other facial features, and they are also associated with an alteration of the task-related activation/deactivation trade-off. Functional connectivity is becoming a powerful tool to examine how components of large-scale distributed neural systems are coupled together while performing a specific function. This study was designed to determine whether functional connectivity networks among brain regions within the distributed system for face perception also would differ between social phobic patients and healthy controls. Data were obtained from eight social phobic patients and seven healthy controls by using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Our findings indicated that social phobic patients and healthy controls have different patterns of functional connectivity across brain regions within both the core and the extended systems for face perception and the default mode network. To our knowledge, this is the first study that shows that functional connectivity during brain response to socially relevant stimuli differs between social phobic patients and healthy controls. These results expand our previous findings and indicate that brain functional changes in social phobic patients are not restricted to a single specific brain structure, but rather involve a mis-communication among different sensory and emotional processing brain areas. © 2010 Danti, Ricciardi, Gentili, Gobbini, Pietrini and Guazzelli.S.","Danti, Sabrina;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Gentili, Claudio;Gobbini, Maria Ida;Pietrini, P.;Guazzelli, Mario",56682722100;8565770200;13204290200;6603437559;7005057128;16405674800

This indicates that hMT+ is truly responsive to motion-related information regardless of visual experience and the sensory modality through which such information is carried to the brain. Here we determined whether the hMT+ complex responds to motion perception per se, that is, motion not perceived through the visual, haptic or aural modalities. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated brain responses in eight congenitally blind and nine sighted volunteers who had been trained to use the tongue display unit (TDU), a sensory substitution device which converts visual information into electrotactile pulses delivered to the tongue, to resolve a tactile motion discrimination task. Stimuli consisted of either static dots, dots moving coherently or dots moving in random directions. Both groups learned the task at the same rate and activated the hMT+ complex during tactile motion discrimination, although at different anatomical locations. Furthermore, the congenitally blind subjects showed additional activations within the dorsal extrastriate cortical pathway.These results extend previous data in support of the supramodal functional organization of hMT+ complex by showing that this cortical area processes motion-related information per se, that is, motion stimuli that are not visual in nature and that are administered to body structures that, in humans, are not primarily devoted to movement perception or spatial location, such as the tongue.

10.1016/j.brainresbull.2009.02.002,133,"The Default Mode Network (DMN) is a constellation of brain areas that decrease their activity during a wide number of different goal-oriented tasks as compared to passive ""rest"" tasks. DMN can be modulated by different factors such as emotional states, cognitive load of the task and psychopathology, including anxiety. Moreover, DMN seems to play a pivotal role in social cognition. For example, the ability to predict another person's behaviour taking his or her perspective modulates the activity of the DMN. Recent data from autistic patients support a role of DMN in social cognition as well. Social Phobia (SP) is an anxiety disorder characterized by an abnormal distress in situations that require social interaction. To date, no study has assessed DMN in Social Phobia. To determine potential differences in DMN activity between Social Phobia patients (SPP) and healthy control (HC) subjects we examined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data obtained during a face perception study with emotional and neutral stimuli. As compared to HC, SPP showed a lower deactivation in the precuneus and posterior cingulate regions (PCun/PCC) during task conditions. These regions are part of the so-called ""Theory of Mind"" circuit and in particular they are involved in the evaluation of one's own emotional state. Because of the role of the PCun/PCC in self-state perception and attribution and, more in general, the role of the DMN in social cognition, we suggest that its impairment in the DMN network in SPP might be relevant in the development of the feeling of wariness of others' judgment and may be related to the so-called self-focused attention. Self-focused attention is the awareness of self-referent information, and is present in many emotional disorders and may additionally prevent individuals from observing external information that could disconfirm their own fears. Moreover, the abnormal modulation of activity in the DMN may reflect persistent rumination or anxiety-related thoughts that are not modulated by the switch from rest to task. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0274-09.2009,109,"Observing and learning actions and behaviors from others, a mechanism crucial for survival and social interaction, engages the mirror neuron system. To determine whether vision is a necessary prerequisite for the human mirror system to develop and function, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare brain activity in congenitally blind individuals during the auditory presentation of hand-executed actions or environmental sounds, and the motor pantomime of manipulation tasks, with that in sighted volunteers, who additionally performed a visual action recognition task. Congenitally blind individuals activated a premotor-temporoparietal cortical network in response to aurally presented actions that overlapped both with mirror system areas found in sighted subjects in response to visually and aurally presented stimuli, and with the brain response elicited by motor pantomime of the same actions. Furthermore, the mirror system cortex showed a significantly greater response to motor familiar than to unfamiliar action sounds in both sighted and blind individuals. Thus, the mirror system in humans can develop in the absence of sight. The results in blind individuals demonstrate that the sound of an action engages the mirror system for action schemas that have not been learned through the visual modality and that this activity is not mediated by visual imagery. These findings indicate that the mirror system is based on supramodal sensory representations of actions and, furthermore, that these abstract representations allow individuals with no visual experience to interact effectively with others.

Perceptual analysis of stimuli dealing with the exact discrimination of size and dimension is related more to mathematical abilities (MATH), while perceptual analysis of direction and spatial orientation is related more to abilities in reading and reading comprehension (READ). Some stimuli are MIXED since they deal with both of the above features combined. We previously determined the distributed neuronal network of analytical-specific visual perceptual processes as measured by the Mangina-Test. Here, we aim at further assessing as to how brain activity is differentially modulated by the discrimination of very subtle category-specific perceptual relationships. Brain activity was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging in 12 young healthy subjects while they performed a computer-adapted version of the Mangina-Test. Behavioral results of the present study indicate that performance was not different among stimulus categories. However, brain functional data show that analytical-specific perceptual processes for MATH, READ and MIXED stimuli rely on partially distinct brain circuits. Bilateral posterior parietal, premotor and prefrontal regions along with the anterior cingulate appeared to be more activated by MATH stimuli, while READ stimuli predominantly activated bilateral medial occipito-temporal, amygdala/parahippocampal and sensorimotor cortices, and the right inferior frontal cortex. Moreover, the posterior parahippocampal cortex showed a higher activity specifically for MIXED stimuli. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that in the Mangina-Test, the exact discrimination of very subtle perceptual relationships between geometrical stimuli distinctly modulates cerebral activity, so that category-specific brain responses can be related to identifiable cognitive abilities. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

10.1016/j.brainresbull.2009.01.013,21,"Age-related differences in the regional recruitment of prefrontal cortex (PFC) during cognitive tasks suggests that aging is associated with functional reorganization. Cholinergic enhancement with physostigmine reduces activity in the PFC regions selectively recruited during working memory (WM) and increases activity in visual processing areas, suggesting that augmenting cholinergic function reduces task effort by improving the visual representation of WM stimuli. Here, we investigated how cholinergic enhancement influenced PFC and visual cortical activity in young and older subjects as WM difficulty was altered. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured using H215O-PET in 10 young and 10 older volunteers during a parametrically varied face WM task, following an i.v. infusion of saline and physostigmine. Reaction time decreased during physostigmine relative to placebo in both groups. Prefrontal brain regions selectively recruited in each age group that responded differentially to task demands during placebo, had no significant activity during physostigmine. Medial visual processing areas showed task-selective increases in activity during drug in both groups, while lateral regions showed decreased activity in young and increased activity in older participants at longer task delays. These results are consistent with our previous findings, showing that the modulatory role of the cholinergic system persists during aging, and that the effects of cholinergic enhancement are functionally specific rather than anatomically specific.

In addition SPP showed a significantly weaker activation in the left fusiform gyrus, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and bilateral intraparietal sulcus as compared to HC. These effects were found not only in response to emotional faces but also to neutral faces as compared to scrambled pictures.

Interestingly, there is evidence that the blind often employ different cognitive mechanisms than sighted subjects, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms can overcome the limitations of sight loss.

,64,"In sighted individuals, both the visual and tactile version of the same spatial working memory task elicited neural responses in the dorsal ""where"" cortical pathway (Ricciardi et al., 2006). Whether the neural response during the tactile working memory task is due to visually-based spatial imagery or rather reflects a more abstract, supramodal organization of the dorsal cortical pathway remains to be determined. To understand the role of visual experience on the functional organization of the dorsal cortical stream, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) here we examined brain response in four individuals with congenital or early blindness and no visual recollection, while they performed the same tactile spatial working memory task, a one-back recognition of 2D and 3D matrices. The blind subjects showed a significant activation in bilateral posterior parietal cortex, dorsolateral and inferior prefrontal areas, precuneus, lateral occipital cortex, and cerebellum. Thus, dorsal occipito-parietal areas are involved in mental imagery dealing with spatial components in subjects without prior visual experience and in response to a non-visual task. These data indicate that recruitment of the dorsal cortical pathway in response to the tactile spatial working memory task is not mediated by visually-based imagery and that visual experience is not a prerequisite for the development of a more abstract functional organization of the dorsal stream. These findings, along with previous data indicating a similar supramodal functional organization within the ventral cortical pathway and the motion processing brain regions, may contribute to explain how individuals who are born deprived of sight are able to interact effectively with the surrounding world.","Bonino, D.;Ricciardi, E.;Sani, L.;Gentili, C.;Vanello, N.;Guazzelli, M.;Vecchi, T.;Pietrini, Pietro",24376198000;8565770200;21735510400;13204290200;6505734003;16405674800;6603719753;7005057128

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the interaction between WM task demands and cholinergic enhancement on neural responses in the prefrontal cortex. Regional cerebral blood f low (rCBF) was measured using H 215O and positron emission tomography, as 10 young healthy volunteers performed a parametrically varied match-to-sample WM for faces task. For each item, a picture of a face was presented, followed by a delay (1, 6, 11, or 16 sec), then by the presentation of two faces. Subjects were instructed to identify which face they previously had seen. For control items, nonsense pictures were presented in the same spatial and temporal manner. All conditions were performed during an intravenous infusion of saline and physostigmine (1 mg/hr). Subjects were blind to the substance being infused. Reaction time increased significantly with WM delay, and physostigmine decreased reaction time across delay conditions. Significant task-related rCBF increases during saline infusion were seen in superior frontal, middle frontal, and inferior frontal regions, and the response magnitudes in the regions increased systematically with task difficulty. In all of these prefrontal regions, physostigmine administration significantly reduced rCBF during task, particularly at longer task delays, so that no correlation between task delay and rCBF was observed. In the ventral visual cortex, physostigmine increased rCBF at longer task delays in medial regions, and decreased rCBF over delay conditions in lateral cortical areas. These results indicate that, during cholinergic potentiation, brain activity in prefrontal regions is not modulated by increases in WM task demands, and lends further support to the hypothesis that cholinergic modulation enhances visual processing, making the task easier to perform, and thus, compensate for the need to recruit prefrontal cortical regions as task demands increase.","Furey, Maura L.;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Schapiro, Mark B.;Rapoport, Stanley I.;Pietrini, Pietro",7004873460;8565770200;7006537812;36037500200;7005057128

ERP and fMRI data were separately recorded from 8 healthy adults during the same experimental conditions. Due to the presence of artifacts in the EEG signals, two subjects were discarded from further analysis. Independent Component Analysis was applied to ERPs, after dimensionality reduction by Principal Component Analysis: some independent components were clearly related to specific reading functions and the associated current density distributions in the brain were estimated with Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography Analysis method (LORETA). The impulse hemodynamic response function was modeled as a linear combination of linear B-spline functions and fMRI statistical analysis was performed by multiple linear regression. fMRI and LORETA maps were superimposed in order to identify the overlapping activations and the activated regions specifically revealed by each modality. The results showed the existence of neuronal networks functionally specific for letter processing and for explicit verbal-motor articulation, including the temporo-parietal and frontal regions. Overlap between fMRI and LORETA results was observed in the inferior temporal-middle occipital gyrus, suggesting that this area has a crucial and multifunctional role for linguistic and reading processes, likely because its spatial location and strong interconnection with the main visual and auditory sensory systems may have favored its specialization in grapheme-phoneme matching.","Casarotto, Silvia;Bianchi, A.

10.1016/j.brainresbull.2008.01.011,52,"Interaction with the external world requires the ability to perceive dynamic changes in complex sensorial input and react promptly. Here, we show that perception of dynamic stimuli in the visual and tactile sensory modalities share fundamental psychophysical aspects that can be explained by similar computational models. In vision, optic flow provides information on relative motion between the individual and the content of percept. For instance, radial patterns of optic flow are used to estimate time before contact with an approaching object [J.J. Gibson, What gives rise to the perception of motion? Psychol. Rev. 75 (1968) 335-346]. Similarly, in the tactile modality, radial patterns of stimuli provide information on softness of probed objects [A. Bicchi, D. De Rossi, E.P. Scilingo, The role of the contact area spread rate (CASR) in haptic discrimination of softness, IEEE Trans. Rob. Autom. 16 (2000) 496-504]. Optic flow is also invoked to explain several visual illusions, including the well-known ""barber-pole"" effect [N. Fisher, J.M. Zanker, The directional tuning of the barber-pole illusion, Perception 30 (2001) 1321-1336]. Here, we introduce a computational model of tactile flow, which is intimately related to existing models for the visual counterpart. The model accounts for psychophysical aspects of dynamic tactile perception and predicts illusory phenomena in the tactile domain, analogous to the barber-pole effect. When subjects touched translating pads with differently oriented gratings, they perceived a direction of motion that was significantly biased towards the orientation of the gratings. Therefore, these findings indicate that visual and tactile flow share similarities at the psychophysical and computational level and may be intended for similar perceptive goals. Results of this analysis have impact on the engineering of better haptic and multimodal interfaces for human-computer interaction. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

10.1093/cercor/bhm018,144,"We investigated whether the visual hMT+ cortex plays a role in supramodal representation of sensory flow, not mediated by visual mental imagery. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure neural activity in sighted and congenitally blind individuals during passive perception of optic and tactile flows. Visual motion-responsive cortex, including hMT+, was identified in the lateral occipital and inferior temporal cortices of the sighted subjects by response to optic flow. Tactile flow perception in sighted subjects activated the more anterior part of these cortical regions but deactivated the more posterior part. By contrast, perception of tactile flow in blind subjects activated the full extent, including the more posterior part. These results demonstrate that activation of hMT+ and surrounding cortex by tactile flow is not mediated by visual mental imagery and that the functional organization of hMT+ can develop to subserve tactile flow perception in the absence of any visual experience. Moreover, visual experience leads to a segregation of the motion-responsive occipitotemporal cortex into an anterior subregion involved in the representation of both optic and tactile flows and a posterior subregion that processes optic flow only. © 2007 The Authors.","Ricciardi, Emiliano;Vanello, Nicola;Sani, Lorenzo;Gentili, Claudio;Scilingo, Enzo Pasquale;Landini, Luigi;Guazzelli, Mario;Bicchi, Antonio;Haxby, James V.;Pietrini, Pietro",8565770200;6505734003;21735510400;13204290200;6601971636;25422522900;16405674800;7004326697;7004857212;7005057128
10.1109/IEMBS.2006.259272,1,"This work proposes a mathematical approach for combining event-related potentials (ERPs) and functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI). Data were separately recorded during the same event-related experimental design, consisting of visually presented single letters and non-alphabetic symbols, that had to be either simply observed (passive condition) or read aloud (active condition). This protocol was useful for exploring the neural correlates of reading processes. Healthy adults participated in the experiment. Averaged ERPs were decomposed by Independent Component Analysis; Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) was applied to estimate the current density distribution maps of each independent component. fMRI images time series were analyzed by multiple linear regression. ERP-fMRI correspondence was quantified by computing the Euclidean distance between LORETA local maxima and clusters of significantly activated fMRI voxels. During reading aloud of letters, that is clearly the task most similar to natural reading conditions, significant electrical and hemodynamic response was observed in the left medial frontal gyrus (BA 6) and left middle temporal gyrus (BA 22/39) just before articulation and in the bilateral middle superior temporal gyrus (BA 22/37) during and after verbal-motor production. These results indicate that the middle-superior temporal gyrus plays a crucial and multifunctional role in grapheme-phoneme matching. ©2006 IEEE.","Casarotto, Silvia;Bianchi, Anna M.;Cerutti, Sergio;Vanello, Nicola;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Gentili, Claudio;Sani, Lorenzo;Bonino, Daniela;Guazzelli, Mario;Pietrini, Pietro;Landini, Luigi;Chiarenza, Giuseppe A.",6507035208;7401727981;7101810821;6505734003;8565770200;13204290200;21735510400;24376198000;16405674800;7005057128;25422522900;7003879191
10.1016/j.neuroscience.2005.08.045,136,"Recent studies of neural correlates of working memory components have identified both low-level perceptual processes and higher-order supramodal mechanisms through which sensory information can be integrated and manipulated. In addition to the primary sensory cortices, working memory relies on a widely distributed neural system of higher-order association areas that includes posterior parietal and occipital areas, and on prefrontal cortex for maintaining and manipulating information. The present study was designed to determine brain patterns of neural response to the same spatial working memory task presented either visually or in a tactile format, and to evaluate the relationship between spatial processing in the visual and tactile sensory modalities. Brain activity during visual and tactile spatial working memory tasks was measured in six young right-handed healthy male volunteers by using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results indicated that similar fronto-parietal networks were recruited during spatial information processing across the two sensory modalities-specifically the posterior parietal cortex, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. These findings provide a neurobiological support to behavioral observations by indicating that common cerebral regions subserve generation of higher order mental representations involved in working memory independently from a specific sensory modality. © 2005 IBRO.","Ricciardi, E.;Bonino, D.;Gentili, C.;Sani, L.;Pietrini, P.;Vecchi, T.",8565770200;24376198000;13204290200;21735510400;7005057128;6603719753

The desired goal is to evoke specific tactile sensations selectively stimulating skin receptors by means of an electric current in place of mechanical stimuli The field of application ranges from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) tactile studies to augmented reality technology. The device here proposed is designed using safety criteria in order to comply with the threshold of voltage and current permitted by regulations. Moreover, MR safety and compatibility criteria were considered in order to perform experiments inside the MR scanner during an fMRI acquisition for functional brain activation analysis. Psychophysical laboratory tests are performed in order to define the different evoked tactile sensation. After verifying the device MR safety and compatibility on a phantom, a test on a human subject during fMRI acquisition is performed to visualize the brain areas activated by the simulated tactile sensation. © 2006 IEEE.","Hartwig, V.;Cappelli, C.;Vanello, N.;Ricciardi, E.;Scilingo, E.

10.1176/appi.ajp.162.11.2061,39,"Objective: Age-associated cholinergic dysfunction may contribute to the cognitive decline observed during aging, including a decline in working memory. The current study was designed to determine how healthy aging influences the neural response to working memory before and during pharmacological potentiation of the cholinergic system. Method: In 13 young and 13 older healthy volunteers, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured by using [15O] H2O and positron emission tomography across 10 scans that alternated between a working-memory-for-faces task and rest. In all subjects, the first two scans were obtained during intravenous saline infusion. Seven young and eight older subjects then received intravenous infusion of physostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, and the remaining six young and five older subjects continued to receive saline. Results: In the placebo condition, task-specific rCBF increases in prefrontal regions were observed in the right middle and inferior frontal cortices in young subjects and in more anterior and ventral prefrontal regions in older individuals. Physostigmine during the working memory task significantly improved performance in both age groups. The right prefrontal regions that were selectively recruited in each age group during the placebo condition showed significantly lower rCBF during physostigmine administration. Conclusions: Cholinergic enhancement does not affect structurally defined cortical regions but rather modulates neural activity in functionally defined regions, that is, in task-related prefrontal cortical areas that are selectively and distinctively recruited in young and older subjects.","Freo, Ulderico;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Pietrini, Pietro;Schapiro, Mark B.;Rapoport, Stanley I.;Furey, Maura L.",6701730091;8565770200;7005057128;7006537812;36037500200;7004873460

We used functional MRI to measure patterns of response evoked during visual and tactile recognition of faces and manmade objects in sighted subjects and during tactile recognition in blind subjects. Results showed that visual and tactile recognition evoked category-related patterns of response in a ventral extrastriate visual area in the inferior temporal gyrus that were correlated across modality for manmade objects. Blind subjects also demonstrated category-related patterns of response in this ""visual"" area, and in more ventral cortical regions in the fusiform gyrus, indicating that these patterns are not due to visual imagery and, furthermore, that visual experience is not necessary for category-related representations to develop in these cortices. These results demonstrate that the representation of objects in the ventral visual pathway is not simply a representation of visual images but, rather, is a representation of more abstract features of object form.","Pietrini, Pietro;Furey, Maura L.;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Gobbini, M.

We examine the behavior of spatial ICA decomposition applying ICA to simulated data sets. We study the ICA performances in presence of movement correlated and uncorrelated with activation task, also taking into account the presence of rician distributed noise. We show that the presence of image artifacts due to simulated subject movement and MRI noise greatly affects the method ability to reveal the activation, especially in the presence of movement correlated with activation task. Spatial smoothing of data, before ICA, seems to overcome this problem, allowing us to retrieve the original sources also in the presence of both correlated movement and high noise level.","Vanello, N.;Positano, V.;Ricciardi, E.;Santarelli, M.

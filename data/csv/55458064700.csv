10.1016/j.adhoc.2008.04.005,65,"Wireless mesh networks are an attractive technology for providing broadband connectivity to mobile clients who are just on the edge of wired networks, and also for building self-organized networks in places where wired infrastructures are not available or not deemed to be worth deploying. This paper investigates the joint link scheduling and routing issues involved in the delivery of a given backlog from any node of a wireless mesh network towards a specific node (which acts as a gateway), within a given deadline. Scheduling and routing are assumed to be aware of the physical interference among nodes, which is modeled in the paper by means of a signal-to-interference ratio. Firstly, we present a theoretical model which allows us to formulate the task of deriving joint routing and scheduling as an integer linear programming problem. Secondly, since the problem cannot be dealt with using exact methods, we propose and use a technique based on genetic algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, these algorithms have never been used before for working out these kinds of optimization problems in a wireless mesh environment. We show that our technique is suitable for this purpose as it provides a good trade-off between fast computation and the overall goodness of the solution found. Our experience has in fact shown that genetic algorithms would seem to be quite promising for solving more complex models than the one dealt with in this paper, such as those including multiple flows and multi-radio multi-channels. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

10.1007/s00500-008-0360-6,92,"Context adaptation (CA) based on evolutionary algorithms is certainly a promising approach to the development of fuzzy rule-based systems (FRBSs). In CA, a context-free model is instantiated to a context-adapted FRBS so as to increase accuracy. A typical requirement in CA is that the context-adapted system maintains the same interpretability as the context-free model, a challenging constraint given that accuracy and interpretability are often conflicting objectives. Furthermore, interpretability is difficult to quantify because of its very nature of being a qualitative concept. In this paper, we first introduce a novel index based on fuzzy ordering relations in order to provide a measure of interpretability. Then, we use the proposed index and the mean square error as goals of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm aimed at generating a set of Pareto-optimum context-adapted Mamdani-type FRBSs with different trade-offs between accuracy and interpretability. CA is obtained through the use of specifically designed operators that adjust the universe of the input and output variables, and modify the core, the support and the shape of fuzzy sets characterizing the partitions of these universes. Finally, we show results obtained by using our approach on synthetic and real data sets. © Springer-Verlag 2008.","Botta, Alessio;Lazzerini, Beatrice;Marcelloni, Francesco;Stefanescu, Dan C.",55458064700;7004016636;7003309696;12753202500
10.1109/WONS.2008.4459355,1,"In this paper, we make use of a fuzzy approach to determine a soft Admission Control mechanism for Voice-over-Internet-Protocol services over Wireless Local Area Network. In such a system, complicated interactions between service provider and clients take place, since the network capacity constraints must be matched with users' preferences and needs. Most of the difficulties in dealing with these interactions stem from the fact that it is very difficult to define both the load condition of the network and the users' requirements in a crisp manner. To this end, we define a framework in which the provider expresses the network status and the clients describe their preferences by means of an approach based on Fuzzy Set Theory. In this way, we are able to develop an Admission Control strategy, based on Similarity Evaluation techniques, that enforces the soft constraints expressed by the two parties. The obtained framework is numerically evaluated, showing the benefit of employing Fuzzy Set Theory with respect to the traditional crisp approach. © 2008 IEEE.","Bacciu, Davide;Botta, Alessio;Badia, Leonardo",23395838700;55458064700;7004191275
10.1002/int.20273,13,"Context adaptation is certainly a promising approach in the development of fuzzy rule based systems (FRBSs). First, an initial rule base is extracted from heuristic knowledge of the application domain. Meanings of linguistic terms are defined so as to guarantee high interpretability of the FRBSs. Then, meanings are adapted to a specific context through the use of operators that, using a set of known input-output patterns, appropriately modify the corresponding fuzzy sets. The choice of the specific operators and their parameters is context based and optimized so as to obtain a good interpretability-accuracy trade-off. In this paper, we propose a set of operators that, starting from a given FRBS, adapt the FRBS to the specific context by adjusting the universes of the input and output variables, and modifying the core, the support and the shape of the fuzzy sets which compose the partitions of these universes. The operators are defined so as to preserve ordering of the linguistic terms, universality of rules, and interpretability of partitions. The choice of the parameters used in the operators is performed by a genetic optimization process aimed at maximizing the accuracy and preserving the interpretability of the FRBS. We finally describe the application of our context adaptation approach to two Mamdani fuzzy systems developed, respectively, for two different domains, namely, regression and data modeling. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Botta, Alessio;Lazzerini, Beatrice;Marcelloni, Francesco",55458064700;7004016636;7003309696

This paper presents a framework for SLA negotiation based on fuzzy sets. We propose (i) a request language for clients to describe quality preferences, (ii) a publication language for providers to define the qualities of their offered services, and (iii) a decision procedure for granting any client request with a SLA contract fitting the requestor requirements. We start with a restricted framework in which the different qualities of a service are handled independently (as being orthogonal) and then we propose an extension that allows clients and providers to express dependencies among different qualities. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.","Bacciu, Davide;Botta, Alessio;Melgratti, Hernán",23395838700;55458064700;10042207200

10.1109/CECW.2005.13,0,"In this paper we present a case example of how heterogeneous services and technologies can be integrated. We show a service-oriented architecture based on web services to perform specific operations, issued by distributed processes through different protocols (HTTP, POP3, RM and SMS), on a particular ERP system, namely the SAP R/3 system. The architecture results from the integration of two different service-oriented technologies: Java Message Service and SAP Java Connector, and uses Business Process Execution Lan-guage for web services choreography. We describe a prototype of the proposed architecture and discuss how a sample business operation, consisting of a pur-chase order input to SAP R/3 from any of a variety of technological devices, can be performed. © 2005 IEEE.","Botta, A.;Lazzerini, B.;Marcelloni, F.",55458064700;7004016636;7003309696

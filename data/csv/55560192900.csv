10.1371/journal.pone.0294149,0,"We apply the independent cascade network inference model to a large database of music videos to infer the structure of the global network of music diffusion. The derived network reveals an intricate topology–fully interconnected, exhibiting a modular structure, and characterized by asymmetric links. We explore the relationship between the identified bilateral cultural diffusion pathways and the geographical and cultural distances among countries, and key socioeconomic interactions such as international trade and migration. Additionally, we use a gravity model to ascertain the factors contributing to both the formation and the intensity of the estimated diffusion channels between countries. Our findings reveal that cultural, geographical, and historical factors serve as primary drivers of musical diffusion, downplaying the importance of economic factors. This study posits that these elements exert considerable force in shaping musical preferences across nations, making the emergence of a homogeneous global musical culture improbable. This exploration adds valuable insights to the discourse on the globalization of music and its potential cultural implications.","Dueñas, Marco;Mandel, Antoine",55560192900;24597928200

While in high-income countries several studies have shown that creative industries are highly innovative and productive, positively impacting the local economy, the evidence is scarce for middle-income countries. Using employment data, we studied the agglomeration patterns of creative industries in Colombia between 2008 and 2017. We found a positive relationship between creative industries’ agglomeration and employment in non-creative services industries. However, using a shift–share instrumental variable approach, we found no significant causality of an increase in creative industries’ employment on employment growth in other industries.","Campi, Mercedes;Dueñas, Marco;Ciarli, Tommaso",56573763900;55560192900;24167714500
10.1057/s41599-021-00775-0,33,"Since the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, governments have been implementing containment measures aimed at mitigating the spread of the virus, including restrictions to human mobility. The ability to adapt to the pandemic and respond to containment measures can be bound by socioeconomic conditions, which are heterogeneous in large urban areas of low-income and middle-income countries. In this paper, we analyse mobility changes following the implementation of containment measures in Bogotá, Colombia. We characterise the mobility network before and during the pandemic and analyse its evolution and changes between January and July 2020. We observe a general reduction in mobility trends, but the overall connectivity between different areas of the city remains after the lockdown, reflecting the resilience of the mobility network. Then, we estimate a gravity model to assess the effect of socioeconomic conditions on mobility flows. We find that the responses to lockdown policies depend on the socioeconomic conditions of the population. Before the pandemic, the population with better socioeconomic conditions shows higher mobility flows. Since the lockdown, mobility presents a general decrease, but the population with worse socioeconomic conditions shows lower reductions in mobility flows. We conclude by deriving policy implications.","Dueñas, Marco;Campi, Mercedes;Olmos, Luis E.",55560192900;56573763900;8366735900
10.1016/j.worlddev.2021.105411,40,"Understanding specialization patterns of countries in food production can provide relevant insights for the evaluation and design of policies seeking to achieve food security and sustainability, which are key to reach several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper builds bipartite networks of food products and food-producing countries, using FAO data from 1993 to 2013, to characterize the global food production system. We use methods from complex systems analysis to rank products according to their need for capabilities and countries according to their competitiveness, which derives from the quality and diversification of their food production baskets. We observe two well-defined communities of food-producing countries, one that groups countries with relatively developed agricultural systems, and the other grouping countries with less developed production systems. The stability of these two communities reveals persistent differences between countries specialization patterns. We econometrically analyze whether and how specialization patterns affect food supply, food security (SDGs: Targets 2.1 and 2.2), and sustainability of food systems (SDGs: Target 2.4). We show that concentrating agricultural production negatively impacts food supply, food security, and food systems sustainability. The competitiveness of countries and the coherence of their diversification patterns increase per capita food supply and food security but might harm sustainability. This evidence reflects the trade-off between achieving food security while simultaneously improving sustainability, which needs to be considered when developing or implementing policies seeking to reach SDGs.","Campi, Mercedes;Dueñas, Marco;Fagiolo, Giorgio",56573763900;55560192900;6507866198
10.1088/1748-9326/abc2f6,18,"Using a complex-network perspective, this paper empirically explores the determinants of the process through which countries, given their capabilities, specialize in agricultural production. Using production data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for the period 1993-2013, we characterize the agricultural production space as a time-sequence of bipartite networks, connecting countries to the agricultural products they produce. We then project this representation in the agricultural production spaces, linking countries or products according to their similarity in production profiles, and we identify properties and determinants underlying their evolution. We find that, despite the unprecedented pressure that food systems have been undergoing in recent years, the agricultural production space is a very dense network displaying well-defined and stable communities of countries and products. We also show that the observed country community structures are not only shaped by environmental conditions, but also by economic, socio-political, and technological factors. We conclude by discussing the implications of such findings on our understanding of the complex relationships involving production capabilities and specialization patterns.","Campi, Mercedes;Duenas, Marco;Fagiolo, Giorgio",56573763900;55560192900;6507866198
10.1016/j.strueco.2019.04.008,7,"This paper analyses the international distribution of GDP per capita growth rates and its dynamics during the twentieth century. We show that the century is characterized by a changing distribution of GDP per capita growth rates, which is reflected in different shapes and a persistent asymmetry at the regional level and for countries of different development levels. Interestingly, the well-known negative scaling relation between growth volatility and country size that characterizes the second half of the century is not observed before the 1950s, period dominated by severe global shocks. We discuss possible explanations to the disruption of the scaling relationship. We argue that in a turbulent context, the functioning and interdependence of economic components of countries of different size can be altered, also affecting the scaling relation between growth volatility and country size. Our results contribute with evidence of the underlying complexity of the growth process and its historical evolution.","Campi, Mercedes;Dueñas, Marco",56573763900;55560192900
10.1007/978-3-030-34127-5_3,0,"This paper studies the dynamics of the formation of inflation expectations in small and open economies, based on an agent-based model (ABM). Agents are assumed to have a limited rationality to adapt their strategies over time and to have difficulty at perceiving the signals from the Central Bank (CB). The CB tries to achieve a target inflation by setting an inflation rate. The monetary authority is committed to a certain level toward which it is directed with monetary policy instruments – the interest rate, in this economy. To achieve this goal, it is essential that the expectations of the private sector get aligned with the objective proposed by the CB. The CB uses a Taylor rule for open economies in order to determine the interest rate. In the case of small and open economies, the inflationary pressures come from internal and external factors. We use a New Keynesian (NK) model with nominal rigidity and adaptive agents in order to study the alternatives of the CB in order to achieve its objectives. Our results show that a high level of credibility of the monetary authority and stable external conditions are necessary for the success of the policies promoted by the CB.","Alvarez, Emiliano;Brida, Juan Gabriel;Dueñas, Marco",57204602809;57269146700;55560192900
10.1016/j.respol.2018.09.011,40,"The global process of strengthening and harmonization of intellectual property rights (IPRs) systems has been intensified in the last twenty five years by the signing of trade agreements (TAs) that include chapters with intellectual property (IP) provisions and other trade-related issues. This paper provides a first exploration of whether and how the signing of TAs with IP chapters influences bilateral trade flows for a balanced panel of 110 countries and the period 1995–2013. We address methodological issues related to the assessment of the effect of TAs on bilateral trade. We use matching econometrics to evaluate the treatment of TAs with and without IP chapters. In addition, we estimate the effects of TAs on bilateral trade in a more dynamic fashion using a panel data approach based on the gravity model. Also, we perform our analysis for trade in low- and high-IP intensive products. We found that both types of TAs increase bilateral trade but TAs with no IPRs chapters have a stronger positive effect on trade. However, if we include lags to consider that TAs with IP chapters might need a longer implementation time, the net expected increase on trade is similar for both types of TAs. We also found that the effects depend on the development level of countries and on the IP intensity of products. We found a clear positive effect for developed countries, but we do not observe important gains for developing countries in all sectors and to all destinations derived from TAs with IP chapters. This raises the question of whether trade gains can compensate the effort related with IP reforms.","Campi, Mercedes;Dueñas, Marco",56573763900;55560192900
10.1080/09638199.2018.1518477,8,"In this paper, we analyze whether the recent global process of strengthening and harmonization of intellectual property rights (IPRs) affects decisions of cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As). We investigate if IPRs have a differential effect across sectors of different technology content and for countries of different development level. Also, we study how imitation abilities of target countries interact with the tightening of IPRs. Using data for the post-TRIPS period (1995–2010), we estimate an extended gravity model to study the bilateral number of M&As, including a measure of the strength of IPRs systems on target countries and a set of control variables usually considered as determinants of M&As. The estimation results verify the gravity structure for M&As and show that IPRs –and enforcement– influence decisions of cross-border M&As in all sectors regardless of their technological content. However, IPRs are more important in countries with high imitation abilities and in sectors of high-technology content. Furthermore, a strengthening of IPRs leads to a larger increase of M&As in developing countries than in developed countries. These results call the attention on the possible implications for least developed economies and challenge the adequacy of a globally harmonized IPRs systems.","Campi, Mercedes;Dueñas, Marco;Barigozzi, Matteo;Fagiolo, Giorgio",56573763900;55560192900;26428037700;6507866198
10.3390/e20100743,8,"In this paper, we analyse the bipartite Colombian firms-products network, throughout a period of five years, from 2010 to 2014. Our analysis depicts a strongly modular system, with several groups of firms specializing in the export of specific categories of products. These clusters have been detected by running the bipartite variant of the traditional modularity maximization, revealing a bi-modular structure. Interestingly, this finding is refined by applying a recently proposed algorithm for projecting bipartite networks on the layer of interest and, then, running the Louvain algorithm on the resulting monopartite representations. Important structural differences emerge upon comparing the Colombian firms-products network with the World Trade Web, in particular, the bipartite representation of the latter is not characterized by a similar block-structure, as the modularity maximization fails in revealing (bipartite) nodes clusters. This points out that economic systems behave differently at different scales: while countries tend to diversify their production-potentially exporting a large number of different products-firms specialize in exporting (substantially very limited) baskets of basically homogeneous products.","Bruno, Matteo;Saracco, Fabio;Squartini, Tiziano;Dueñas, Marco",57204464985;36344077800;36912065800;55560192900
10.1038/s41598-017-10779-z,15,"This paper analyses the world web of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) using a complex network approach. We use data of M&As to build a temporal sequence of binary and weighted-directed networks for the period 1995-2010 and 224 countries (nodes) connected according to their M&As flows (links). We study different geographical and temporal aspects of the international M&A network (IMAN), building sequences of filtered sub-networks whose links belong to specific intervals of distance or time. Given that M&As and trade are complementary ways of reaching foreign markets, we perform our analysis using statistics employed for the study of the international trade network (ITN), highlighting the similarities and differences between the ITN and the IMAN. In contrast to the ITN, the IMAN is a low density network characterized by a persistent giant component with many external nodes and low reciprocity. Clustering patterns are very heterogeneous and dynamic. High-income economies are the main acquirers and are characterized by high connectivity, implying that most countries are targets of a few acquirers. Like in the ITN, geographical distance strongly impacts the structure of the IMAN: link-weights and node degrees have a non-linear relation with distance, and an assortative pattern is present at short distances.","Dueñas, Marco;Mastrandrea, Rossana;Barigozzi, Matteo;Fagiolo, Giorgio",55560192900;56150284600;26428037700;6507866198
10.1016/j.worlddev.2015.11.014,22,"The signing of the agreement on Trade-Related Aspects on Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) had led to a process of global harmonization and tightening of intellectual property rights (IPRs) systems. As part of this process, the use of IPRs in agriculture has been increasing in the last decades. This paper studies the effect of intellectual property rights on agricultural trade, for the post-TRIPS period (1995-2011), using a new yearly index of IPRs, for 60 developed and developing countries. We study the effect of stronger IPRs on total trade, bilateral trade, and trade margins using different econometric techniques. We found that the strengthening of IPRs has been having a negative and uneven effect on agricultural trade at different levels of disaggregation. The gravity estimation showed that both the IPRs of the importer and the exporter have negative effects on total bilateral trade and that the probability of creating new bilateral trade links increases with the importer's IPRs. Finally, we found that stronger IPRs have a negative effect on the intensive margin of trade and a positive impact on the extensive margin. Overall, the evidence shows that agricultural trade related to the developing world has been more negatively affected, which calls the attention to the idea that a common system can equally work for all countries.","Campi, Mercedes;Dueñas, Marco",56573763900;55560192900
10.1142/S0219525914500143,9,"In this paper, we study trade imbalances between world countries in the period 1960-2011 using a complex-network approach. We show that trade imbalances in absolute value are characterized by a hierarchical arrangement wherein a few developed economies display high clustering and carry an important amount of global-trade imbalances. In contrast, trade imbalances in relative terms show a more fragmented topology, with less concentrated clustering which is particularly high for developing countries. In addition, we find that traditional null random-network models and the gravity model poorly predict the topology of trade imbalance networks. Our main finding is that the evolution of international trade has caused very heterogeneous imbalances in world economies, which may have important consequences for global instability and development. © World Scientific Publishing Company.","Dueñas, Marco;Fagiolo, Giorgio",55560192900;6507866198

We fit data on trade flows with a GM using alternative estimation techniques and we build GM-based predictions for the weighted topological properties of the ITN, which are then compared to the observed ones. Our exercises show that the GM: (i) may replicate part of the weighted-network structure only if the observed binary architecture is kept fixed; (ii) is not able to explain higher-order statistics that, like clustering, require the knowledge of triadic link-weight topological patterns, even if the binary structure perfectly replicates the observed one; (iii) performs very badly when asked to predict the presence of a link, or the level of the trade flow it carries, whenever the binary structure must be simultaneously estimated. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Dueñas, Marco;Fagiolo, Giorgio",55560192900;6507866198
10.1142/S0217979210057249,0,"Experimental realizations of a two-qubit quantum logic gate based on cold atom collisions have been elusive mainly due to the decoherence effects introduced during the quantum gate operation, which cause transitions out of the two-qubit space and lead to a decreased gate operation fidelity. This type of decoherence effects, due to the non closeness of the interacting two-qubit system, are characteristic of the electromagnetic interaction, since the electromagnetic vacuum acts as a reservoir whose eigenmodes might become active during the gate operation. To describe the cold-atom collision we consider the quantum non-Hermitian dipole-dipole interaction instead of the less realistic s-scattering approach widely used in the literature. By adding an ancillary qubit, we take advantage of the spatial modulation of the non-Hermitian part of the interaction potential to obtain a ""resonant"" condition that should be satisfied to achieve lossless operation of a specific two-qubit quantum phase-gate. We demonstrate that careful engineering of the collision is required to obtain a specific truth table and to suppress the effects inherent in the openness of the system arising from the electromagnetic interaction. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.","GuzmÁn, Angela M.;DueÑas E., Marco A.",7102622287;55560192900

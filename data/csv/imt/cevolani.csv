The pervasiveness of multiple discoveries in science suggests the intuition that they are in some sense inevitable—that one should view them as results that force themselves upon us, so to speak. We argue that, despite the intuitive force of such an “inevitabilist insight,” one should reject it. More specifically, we distinguish two facets of the insight and argue that: (a) the profusion of multiple discoveries in scientific practice does not support the inevitabilist side of the inevitability/contingency of science controversy; and (b) the crucial role of background knowledge in scientific inquiry complicates the attempt to interpret the pervasiveness of multiple discoveries in realist terms. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Contingency thesis; Inevitability thesis; Multiple discoveries; Scientific realism","Knowledge; knowledge","Allamel-Raffin C., Gangloff J.-L., Some remarks about the definitions of contingentism and inevitabilism, Science as it could have been.

Existing accounts of truthlikeness or verisimilitude address this problem, but are usually limited to the problem of approaching a “deterministic” truth by means of deterministic theories. A general theory of truth approximation, however, should arguably cover also cases where either the relevant theories, or “the truth”, or both, are “probabilistic” in nature. As a step forward in this direction, we first present a general characterization of both deterministic and probabilistic truth approximation; then, we introduce a new account of verisimilitude which provides a simple formal framework to deal with such issue in a unified way. The connections of our account with some other proposals in the literature are also briefly discussed. © 2021, The Author(s).","(Dis)agreement; Divergence; Information; Probability; Similarity; Truth approximation; Truthlikeness; Verisimilitude","","Brier G.W., Verification of forecasts expressed in terms of probability, Monthly Weather Review, 78, 1, pp. 1-3, (1950); Carnap R., Logical foundations of probability, (1950); Cevolani G., Truth approximation, belief merging, and peer disagreement, Synthese, 191, 11, pp. 2383-2401, (2014); Cevolani G., Truthlikeness and the problem of measure sensitivity, EPSA15 selected papers, pp. 257-271, (2017); Cevolani G., Approaching truth in conceptual spaces, Erkenntnis, 6, 85, pp. 1485-1500, (2020); Cevolani G., Festa R., A partial consequence account of truthlikeness, Synthese, 197, pp. 1627-1646, (2020); Cevolani G., Crupi V., Festa R., Verisimilitude and belief change for conjunctive theories, Erkenntnis, 75, 2, pp. 183-202, (2011); Cevolani G., Festa R., Kuipers T.A.F., Verisimilitude and belief change for nomic conjunctive theories, Synthese, 190, 16, pp. 3307-3324, (2013); Crupi V., Tentori K., Confirmation as partial entailment: A representation theorem in inductive logic, Journal of Applied Logic, 11, 4, pp. 364-372, (2013); Crupi V., Nelson J., Meder B., Cevolani G., Tentori K., Generalized information theory meets human cognition: Introducing a unified framework to model uncertainty and information search, Cognitive Science, 42, pp. 1410-1456, (2018); Festa R., Optimum inductive methods, (1993); Festa R., Verisimilitude, qualitative theories, and statistical inferences, Approaching Truth: Essays in Honour of Ilkka Niiniluoto, pp. 143-178, (2007); Festa R., Verisimilitude, cross classification, and prediction logic.

In particular, politicians, scientists, physicians, and other professionals may face new ethical dilemmas and cognitive constraints as they make critical decisions in extraordinary circumstances. Philosophers and cognitive scientists have long analyzed and discussed such issues. An example is the debate on moral decision making in imaginary scenarios, such as the famous “Trolley Problem”. Similarly, dramatic and consequential decisions are realized daily in the current crisis. Focusing on Italy, we discuss the clinical ethical guidelines proposed by the Italian Society of Anesthesiology, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI), highlighting some crucial ethical and cognitive concerns surrounding emergency decision making in the current situation. © Chiara Lucifora, Gustavo Cevolani 2020.","Bias; Clinical Decision Making; Cognition; COVID-19; Moral Dilemmas; Rationality","","AWAD E., DSOUZA S., KIM R., SCHULZ J., HENRICH J., SHARIFF A., BONNEFON J.

Advocated by such authors as Ilkka Niiniluoto and Theo Kuipers, VS is the view that progress can be explained in terms of the increasing verisimilitude (or, equivalently, truthlikeness, or approximation to the truth) of scientific theories. According to Bird, VS overlooks the central issue of the appropriate grounding of scientific beliefs in the evidence, and it is therefore unable (a) to reconstruct in a satisfactory way some hypothetical cases of scientific progress, and (b) to provide an explanation of the aversion to falsity that characterizes scientific practice. We rebut both of these criticisms and argue that they reveal a misunderstanding of some key concepts underlying VS. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","","","Bird A., What is scientific progress?, Noûs, 41, pp. 64-89, (2007); Bird A., Scientific progress as accumulation of knowledge.

This is especially true within the courts: understanding how uncertainty affects the processes of reasoning, inference, and decision-making in the judiciary is a crucial and urgent issue. In this paper, we analyze judicial reasoning in the context of evidence evaluation in the criminal trial, with reference to the debate on “legal probabilism”, i.e., the idea that judicial reasoning should be analyzed with the tools of probability and decision theory. Against legal probabilism, a number of objections have been raised, including the so-called puzzles of (merely) statistical evidence, which seem to show the untenability of that idea, especially in relation to the principle of “beyond a reasonable doubt” as a standard of evidence. Using cognitive decision theory as an epistemological framework, we defend a qualified version of legal probabilism, based on the notion of truthlikeness (or verisimilitude or approximation to truth) as it is studied in contemporary philosophy of science. © 2023,Sistemi Intelligenti.

In this paper, we investigate the relationships between two ongoing research programs providing formal treatments of theory change: the (post-Popperian) approach to verisimilitude and the AGM theory of belief change. We show that appropriately construed accounts emerging from those two lines of epistemological research do yield convergences relative to a specified kind of theories, here labeled ""conjunctive"". In this domain, a set of plausible conditions are identified which demonstrably capture the verisimilitudinarian effectiveness of AGM belief change, i. e., its effectiveness in tracking truth approximation.

One important application is to quantify the expected usefulness of possible experiments (or questions or tests). Many different entropy models could be used; different models do not in general lead to the same conclusions about which tests (or experiments) are most valuable. It is often unclear whether this is due to different theoretical and practical goals or are merely due to historical accident. We introduce a unified two-parameter family of entropy models that incorporates a great deal of entropies as special cases. This family of models offers insight into heretofore perplexing psychological results, and generates predictions for future research. © CogSci 2017.","entropy; information; information gain, probability gain; uncertainty","Entropy model; Information; Information gain; Information gain, probability gain; Philosophy of science; Two parameter; Uncertainty; Unified Modeling; Value of information","Arimoto S., Information-theoretical considerations on estimation problems, Information and Control, 19, pp. 181-194, (1971); Baron J., Beattie J., Hershey J.

As intuitively compelling as this definition may be, it is untenable, as proved long ago; still, one can arguably rely on Popper’s intuition to provide an adequate account of truthlikeness. To this aim, we mobilize some classical work on partial entailment in defining a new measure of truthlikeness which satisfies a number of desiderata.

We argue that it is not allegiance to realism or antirealism as such that primarily dictates one’s response to the possibility of radical theoretical novelty: what matters the most is, rather, the proposed alternative’s promise to realize one’s favored cognitive aim(s). Our argument tells not only against Stanford’s account of how adherence to realism or antirealism orients how one responds to possible radical theoretical novelty, but also against what we call the “natural pairing thesis.” According to such a thesis, which has kept resurfacing in the history of the philosophy of science, one-to-one pairings obtain between realism/antirealism, on the one hand, and theoretical conservatism/openness to radical theoretical novelty, on the other hand. As our argument suggests, however, when faced with the possibility of radical theoretical novelty, realists can respond either in a conservative way or by being open to theory change, not unlike antirealists. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Antirealism; Radical theoretical novelty; Realism; Scientific progress; Theoretical conservatism; Theory change","","Blackmore J., Ernst Mach, (1973); Bschir K., Feyerabend and Popper on theory proliferation and anomaly import: On the compatibility of theoretical pluralism and critical rationalism, HOPOS: The Journal of The International Society for The History of Philosophy of Science, 5, pp. 24-55, (2015); Chang H., The coherence of Feyerabend’s pluralist realism., pp. 40-56, (2021); Dellsen F., Should scientific realists embrace theoretical conservatism?, Studies in History and Philosophy of Science, 76, pp. 30-38, (2019); Farrell R.P., (2003); Feyerabend P.K., (1964); Feyerabend P.K., [1984]).

Two of the best known formal accounts of theory change are the post-Popperian theories of verisimilitude (PPV for short) and the AGM theory of belief change (AGM for short). In this paper, we will investigate the conceptual relations between PPV and AGM and, in particular, we will ask whether the AGM rules for theory change are effective means for approaching the truth, i.e., for achieving the cognitive aim of science pointed out by PPV. First, the key ideas of PPV and AGM and their application to a particular kind of propositional theories-the so called conjunctive propositions-will be illustrated. Afterwards, we will prove that, as far as conjunctive propositions are concerned, AGM belief change is an effective tool for approaching the truth. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","","","Alchourron C., Gardenfors P., Makinson D., On the logic of theory change: Partial meet contraction and revision functions, J Symbol Logic, 50, pp. 510-530, (1985); Cevolani G., Festa R., Scientific change, belief dynamics and truth approximation, La Nuova Critica, 51-52, pp. 27-59, (2009); Cevolani G., Crupi V., Festa R., The whole truth about Linda: Probability, verisimilitude and a paradox of conjunction, Selected Papers from the SILFS07 Conference, (2009); Cevolani G., Crupi V., Festa R., Verisimilitude and Belief Change for Conjunctive Theories; Festa R., The qualitative and statistical verisimilitude of qualitative theories, La Nuova Critica, 47-48, pp. 91-114, (2007); Festa R., Verisimilitude, cross classification, and prediction logic.

In particular, we show that adequately combining probability, approximate truth, and truthlikeness leads to an explanation of how rational belief is possible in the face of the Preface Paradox.

On the one hand, the “heuristics and biases” research program highlighted how human reasoners often fail to conform to normative standards of rationality, falling prey to systematic and predictable “cognitive illusions”. On the other hand, further research explored how to design communication strategies and reasoning tools that are more ergonomic - that is, that make easier and more transparent the processing and evaluation of complex information. Here, we report on a preliminary analysis (including a pilot study) of understanding and communication of statistical information concerning COVID-19-related risks among the public. Our tentative conclusions are as follows: first, in line with previous literature, transparent communication using a “natural frequency” format (instead of percentages or probabilities) does improve understanding; second, many important institutions do not employ cognitively ergonomic communication strategies, leaving much room for further improvement. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Base-rate fallacy; Cognitive ergonomics; COVID-19; Heuristics; Risk communication","","Branaghan R., Lafko S., Cognitive Ergonomics, (2019); Dempsey P.G., Wogalter M.S., Hancock P.A., Defining ergonomics/human factors, International Encyclopedia of Ergonomics and Human Factors, pp. 32-35, (2006); Eddy D., Probabilistical reasoning in clinical medicine: Problems and opportunities, Judgement under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases, pp. 249-267, (1982); Furedi A., Social consequences.

We explore these ideas in the context of supervised machine learning, namely the branch of artificial intelligence that studies algorithms which balance simplicity and accuracy in order to effectively learn about the features of the underlying domain. Focusing on statistical learning theory, we show that situations exist for which a preference for simpler models (as modeled through the addition of a regularization term in the learning problem) provably slows down, instead of favoring, the supervised learning process. Our results shed new light on the relations between simplicity and truth approximation, which are briefly discussed in the context of both machine learning and the philosophy of science. © 2022, The Author(s).","Complexity; Machine learning; Occam’s razor; Sample size; Simplicity; Statistical learning theory; Truth approximation; Vapnik–Chervonenkis dimension","Complexity; Learn+; Occam’s razor; Sample sizes; Simple modeling; Simplicity; Statistical learning theory; Supervised machine learning; Truth approximation; Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimensions; Supervised learning","Baker A., Simplicity, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

My case-study is provided by the theory of truthlikeness (or verisimilitude), construed as closeness to “the whole truth” about a given domain, as described in the underlying language. I show how modeling propositions and their relations within a conceptual space has interesting implications for two issues in truthlikeness theory: the so called problem of language dependence, and that of measure sensitivity.

It turns out that the most adequate proposal is that based on the notion of “partial truth”, which measures the amount of “information about the truth” conveyed by a given statement.

I then argue that the notion of verisimilitude or truthlikeness could be usefully applied within the theory of dialectical structures to provide a richer account of how debate dynamics can be truth conducive.

We answer this question by proving some formal results on how belief merging operators perform with respect to the task of truth approximation, construed as increasing verisimilitude or truthlikeness. Our results shed new light on the issue of how rational (dis)agreement affects the inquirers’ quest for truth. In particular, they vindicate the intuition that scientific inquiry, and rational discussion in general, benefits from some heterogeneity in opinion and interaction among different viewpoints.

Reverse inference is usually opposed to “forward” inference, when the engagement of a certain cognitive process is assumed, and its neural correlate is inferred from the experimental evidence. Despite its central role in neuroscientific practice, in recent years reverse inference faced increasing skepticism, especially after leading neuroscientist Russell Poldrack denounced its limits and espoused its methodological weaknesses. In this paper, we critically discuss Poldrack’s Bayesian analysis of reverse inference, and point to some pros and cons of his proposal. The upshot of our discussion is that, while the Bayesian account of reverse inference is ultimately sound and promising, its current application in the neuroscience literature faces some important issues. In particular, we argue that the widespread use of flat priors in analyzing data i) blurs a crucial distinction between probability and confirmation, ii) makes the Bayesian analysis collapsing on a “likelihoodist” one, and iii) risks to conflate the basic concepts of forward and reverse inference. © 2022, Sistemi Intelligenti.

In medicine, for instance, careful choice of a diagnostic test can help narrow down the range of plausible diseases that the patient might have. In a probabilistic framework, test selection is often modeled by assuming that people's goal is to reduce uncertainty about possible states of the world. In cognitive science, psychology, and medical decision making, Shannon entropy is the most prominent and most widely used model to formalize probabilistic uncertainty and the reduction thereof. However, a variety of alternative entropy metrics (Hartley, Quadratic, Tsallis, Rényi, and more) are popular in the social and the natural sciences, computer science, and philosophy of science. Particular entropy measures have been predominant in particular research areas, and it is often an open issue whether these divergences emerge from different theoretical and practical goals or are merely due to historical accident. Cutting across disciplinary boundaries, we show that several entropy and entropy reduction measures arise as special cases in a unified formalism, the Sharma–Mittal framework. Using mathematical results, computer simulations, and analyses of published behavioral data, we discuss four key questions: How do various entropy models relate to each other? What insights can be obtained by considering diverse entropy models within a unified framework? What is the psychological plausibility of different entropy models? What new questions and insights for research on human information acquisition follow? Our work provides several new pathways for theoretical and empirical research, reconciling apparently conflicting approaches and empirical findings within a comprehensive and unified information-theoretic formalism. © 2018 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.","Entropy;

Then, we explore some of D'Alembert objections to this approach, and we discuss how these criticisms survive to date both in the theoretical debate on foundational aspects of Rational Decision Theory and in the discussion over its adequacy as a model for decision-making under uncertainty. © 2023 Societa Editrice il Mulino.

The Preface paradox is usually taken to show that the Lockean thesis is untenable, if one also assumes that rational agents should believe the conjunction of their own beliefs: high probability and rational belief are in a sense incompatible. In this paper, we show that this is not the case in general. More precisely, we consider two methods of computing how probable must each of a series of propositions be in order to rationally believe their conjunction under the Lockean thesis.

While widely employed in experimental studies, it is now viewed with increasing scepticism within the neuroscience community. One problem with reverse inference is that it is logically invalid, being an instance of abduction in Peirce’s sense. In this paper, we offer the first systematic analysis of reverse inference as a form of abductive reasoning and highlight some relevant implications for the current debate. We start by formalising an important distinction that has been entirely neglected in the literature, namely the distinction between weak (strategic) and strong (justificatory) reverse inference. Then, we rely on case studies from recent neuroscientific research to systematically discuss the role and limits of both strong and weak reverse inference; in particular, we offer the first exploration of weak reverse inference as a discovery strategy within cognitive neuroscience. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Abduction; Cognitive neuroscience; Discovery; Justification; Reverse inference","","Anderson D.R., Creativity and the philosophy of C.S.

Research has highlighted both the cognitive strategies employed in legal reasoning, and the cognitive pitfalls judges and other experts tend to fall prey to. In this paper, we focus on the “conjunction fallacy”, a widespread phenomenon showing that human reasoners systematically violate the rules of probability calculus. After presenting the fallacy as documented in judicial reasoning, we present two formal accounts of the phenomenon, respectively based on the notions of confirmation (evidential support) and truthlikeness (closeness to the truth) as studied in the philosophy of science. With reference to the “story-model” of legal decision-making, we clarify the role that “cognitive utilities” like truth, probability, and information play in legal reasoning, and how it can account for the documented fallacies. We conclude by suggesting some directions for further investigation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cognitive utility; Confirmation; Evidence; Information; Legal and judicial reasoning; Probability; Story-model; Truth(likeness)","","Bovens L., Hartmann S., Bayesian Epistemology, (2003); Carnap R., Logical Foundations of Probability, 2Nd Edn., 1St Edn, (1962); Cevolani G., Truthlikeness and the problem of measure sensitivity, EPSA15 Selected Papers, pp. 257-271, (2017); Cevolani G., Crupi V., Subtleties of naive reasoning.

As an illustration, I focus on the idea of cognitive progress as increasing truthlikeness. In particular, I show that some basic arguments concerning truth approximation through belief change are not invariant across the different truthlikeness measures proposed in the literature. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Belief change; Formal models; Measure sensitivity; Scientific progress; Truth approximation; Truthlikeness; Verisimilitude","","Aronson J., Harre R., Way E.C., Realism Rescued.

De-idealization occurs when an idealized assumption of a theoretical model is replaced with a more realistic one. Recently, some scholars have raised objections against the possibility or fruitfulness of de-idealizing economic models, suggesting that economists do not employ this kind of strategy. We present a detailed case study from the theory of industrial organization, discussing three different models, two of which can be construed as de-idealized versions of the first (the so-called Bertrand model of oligopoly). We conclude that recent pessimism about de-idealization in economics is largely unfounded, and that de-idealization strategies are not only possible but also widely employed in economics. © The Author(s) 2021.","Bertrand model; concretization; de-idealization; economic models; idealization; industrial organization","","Alexandrova A., Connecting Economic Models to the Real World: Game Theory and the FCC Spectrum Auctions, Philosophy of the Social Sciences, 36, 2, pp. 173-192, (2006); Alexandrova A., Making Models Count, Philosophy of Science, 75, 3, pp. 383-404, (2008); Alexandrova A., Northcott R., Progress in Economics: Lessons from the Spectrum Auctions, Oxford Handbook for Philosophy of Economics, pp. 306-336, (2009); Aydinonat E.N., The Diversity of Models as a Means to Better Explanations in Economics, Journal of Economic Methodology, 25, 3, pp. 237-251, (2018); Baye M., Morgan J., Information Gatekeepers on the Internet and the Competitiveness of Homogeneous Product Markets, American Economic Review, 91, 3, pp. 454-474, (2001); Baye M., Morgan J., Scholten P., Information, Search, and Price Dispersion, Handbook on Economics and Information Systems, pp. 323-375, (2006); Belleflamme P., Peitz M., Industrial Organization: Markets and Strategies, (2015); Bertrand J., Review of Theorie mathematique de la Richesse Social and of Recherches sur les Principes Mathematiques de la Theorie des Richesses, Journal des Savants, pp. 499-508, (1883); Cartwright N., Nature’s Capacities and Their Measurement, (1989); Cevolani G., Tambolo L., Progress as Approximation to the Truth: A Defence of the Verisimilitudinarian Approach, Erkenntnis, 78, 4, pp. 921-935, (2013); Cools K., Bert H., Theo K., Truth Approximation by Concretization in Capital Structure Theory, Idealization VI: Idealization in Economics, pp. 205-228, (1994); Dhami S., The Foundations of Behavioral Economic Analysis, (2016); Dixit A., A Model of Duopoly Suggesting a Theory of Entry Barriers, Bell Journal of Economics, 10, 1, pp. 20-32, (1979); Eaton B.C., Lipsey R.G., Product Differentiation, Handbook of Industrial Organization, 1, pp. 723-768, (1989); Edgeworth F.Y., Papers Relating to Political Economy, (1925); Einav L., Levin J., Empirical Industrial Organization: A Progress Report, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 24, 2, pp. 145-162, (2010); Fehr E., Klaus M.S., A theory of fairness, competition, and cooperation, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 114, 3, pp. 817-868, (1999); Grabner C., Strunk B., Pluralism in Economics: Its Critiques and Their Lessons, Journal of Economic Methodology, 27, 4, pp. 311-329, (2020); Grune-Yanoff T., Preface to ’Economic Models as Credible Worlds or as Isolating Tools?, Erkenntnis, 70, 1, pp. 1-2, (2009); Grune-Yanoff T., Marchionni C., Modeling Model Selection in Model Pluralism, Journal of Economic Methodology, 25, 3, pp. 265-275, (2018); Hindriks F., Tractability Assumptions and the Musgrave–Mäki Typology, Journal of Economic Methodology, 13, 4, pp. 401-423, (2006); Hindriks F., Saving Truth for Economics, Economics for Real: Uskali Mäki and the Place of Truth in Economics, pp. 43-64, (2012); Hotelling H., Stability in Competition, Economic Journal, 39, 153, pp. 41-57, (1929); Knuuttila T., Isolating Representations Versus Credible Constructions?

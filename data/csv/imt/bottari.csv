Cerebral visual impairment is a brain-based visual disorder associated with the maldevelopment of central visual pathways and structures. However, the neurophysiological basis underlying higher-order perceptual impairments in this condition has not been clearly identified, which in turn poses limits on developing rehabilitative interventions. Using combined eye tracking and EEG recordings, we assessed the profile and performance of visual search on a naturalistic virtual reality-based task. Participants with cerebral visual impairment and controls with neurotypical development were instructed to search, locate and fixate on a specific target placed among surrounding distractors at two levels of task difficulty. We analysed evoked (phase-locked) and induced (non-phase-locked) components of broadband (4-55â€ Hz) neural oscillations to uncover the neurophysiological basis of visuospatial processing. We found that visual search performance in cerebral visual impairment was impaired compared to controls (as indexed by outcomes of success rate, reaction time and gaze error). Analysis of neural oscillations revealed markedly reduced early-onset evoked theta [4-6â€ Hz] activity (within 0.5â€ s) regardless of task difficulty. Moreover, while induced alpha activity increased with task difficulty in controls, this modulation was absent in the cerebral visual impairment group identifying a potential neural correlate related to deficits with visual search and distractor suppression. Finally, cerebral visual impairment participants also showed a sustained induced gamma response [30-45â€ Hz]. We conclude that impaired visual search performance in cerebral visual impairment is associated with substantial alterations across a wide range of neural oscillation frequencies. This includes both evoked and induced components suggesting the involvement of feedforward and feedback processing as well as local and distributed levels of neural processing.  © 2023 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Guarantors of Brain.","cerebral visual impairment; feedback; feedforward; neural oscillations; visual search","","Dutton GN, Lueck AH., Impairment of vision due to damage to the brain, Vision and the brain: Understanding cerebral visual impairment in children, pp. 3-20, (2015); Sakki HEA, Dale NJ, Sargent J, Perez-Roche T, Bowman R., Is there consensus in defining childhood cerebral visual impairment?

This study investigated whether vision influences the development and functioning of these fundamental sound computations. We employed a computational approach to control statistical properties embedded in sounds and tested samples of sighted controls (SC) and congenitally (CB) and late-onset (LB) blind individuals in two experiments. In experiment 1, performance relied on local features analysis; in experiment 2, performance benefited from computing global representations. In both experiments, SC and CB performance remarkably overlapped. Conversely, LB performed systematically worse than the other groups when relying on local features, with no alterations on global representations. Results suggest that auditory computations tested here develop independently from vision. The efficiency of local auditory processing can be hampered in case sight becomes unavailable later in life, supporting the existence of an audiovisual interplay for the processing of auditory details, which emerges only in late development. © 2021 The Author(s)","Biological sciences; Neuroscience; Sensory neuroscience","","Amedi A., Raz N., Pianka P., Malach R., Zohary E., Early ‘visual'cortex activation correlates with superior verbal memory performance in the blind, Nat.

Neural responses are typically reduced upon stimulus repetition, a phenomenon called Repetition Suppression (RS). On the contrary, following a novel visual stimulus, the neural response is generally enhanced, a phenomenon referred to as Novelty Detection (ND). Here, we aimed to investigate the impact of early deafness on the oscillatory signatures of RS and ND brain responses. To this aim, electrophysiological data were acquired in early deaf and hearing control individuals during processing of repeated and novel visual events unattended by participants. By studying evoked and induced oscillatory brain activities, as well as inter-trial phase coherence, we linked response modulations to feedback and/or feedforward processes. Results revealed selective experience-dependent changes on both RS and ND mechanisms. Compared to hearing controls, early deaf individuals displayed: (i) greater attenuation of the response following stimulus repetition, selectively in the induced theta-band (4–7 Hz); (ii) reduced desynchronization following the onset of novel visual stimuli, in the induced alpha and beta bands (8–12 and 13–25 Hz); (iii) comparable modulation of evoked responses and inter-trial phase coherence. The selectivity of the effects in the induced responses parallels findings observed in the auditory cortex of deaf animal models following intracochlear electric stimulation. The present results support the idea that early deafness alters induced oscillatory activity and the functional tuning of basic visual processing. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Deafness; Neural oscillations;

Here we studied the recovery of spatial hearing in two sequential bilateral CI recipients, adopting a longitudinal approach. Each recipient was tested in a sound-source identification task shortly after bilateral activation and at 1, 6, and 12 months follow-up. The results show fast recovery (1 month from CI activation) in the recipient who had substantial experience with auditory cues in adulthood. By contrast, the bilateral CI recipient who developed profound deafness in childhood, regained spatial hearing abilities only 12 months after CI activation. These findings provide the first direct evidence that recovery of auditory spatial abilities in bilateral CI recipients can occur shortly after activation of the two devices. In addition, they suggest that previous auditory experience can constrain the time course of this recovery. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, only few neural markers of sensitive period plasticity in humans are known. Here we employed electroencephalographic recordings in a unique sample of twelve humans who had been blind from birth and regained sight through cataract surgery between four months and 16 years of age. Two additional control groups were tested: a group of visually impaired individuals without a history of total congenital blindness and a group of typically sighted individuals. The EEG was recorded while participants performed a visual discrimination task involving intact and scrambled biological motion stimuli. Posterior alpha and theta oscillations were evaluated. The three groups showed indistinguishable behavioral performance and in all groups evoked theta activity varied with biological motion processing. By contrast, alpha oscillatory activity was significantly reduced only in individuals with a history of congenital cataracts. These data document on the one hand brain mechanisms of functional recovery (related to theta oscillations) and on the other hand, for the first time, a sensitive period for the development of alpha oscillatory activity in humans.","","Adolescent;

We tested congenitally deaf (CD) signers and matched hearing controls (HC) to investigate the experience dependence of the cortical organization of face processing. Specifically, we used EEG frequency-tagging to evaluate: (1) Face-Object Categorization, (2) Emotional Facial-Expression Discrimination and (3) Individual Face Discrimination. The EEG was recorded to visual stimuli presented at a rate of 6 Hz, with oddball stimuli at a rate of 1.2 Hz. In all three experiments and in both groups, significant face discriminative responses were found. Face-Object categorization was associated to a relative increased involvement of the left hemisphere in CD individuals compared to HC individuals. A similar trend was observed for Emotional Facial-Expression discrimination but not for Individual Face Discrimination. Source reconstruction suggested a greater activation of the auditory cortices in the CD group for Individual Face Discrimination. These findings suggest that the experience dependence of the relative contribution of the two hemispheres as well as crossmodal plasticity vary with different aspects of face processing. © 2020 The Authors","Auditory deprivation; Face-processing; Frequency-tagging; Neural plasticity; Sign Language","Adult; Brain; Brain Waves; Deafness; Electroencephalography; Facial Expression; Facial Recognition; Female; Functional Laterality; Humans; Male; Neuronal Plasticity; Photic Stimulation; Sign Language; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Young Adult; adult; article; auditory cortex; controlled study; electroencephalogram; facial recognition; female; hearing impaired person; human; human experiment; left hemisphere; male; nerve cell plasticity; sign language; brain; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography; facial expression; facial recognition; hearing impairment; hemispheric dominance; pathophysiology; photostimulation; physiology; sign language; signal processing; young adult","Anzures G., Quinn P.C., Pascalis O., Slater A.M., Tanaka J.W., Lee K., Developmental origins of the other-race effect, Curr.

Here, we investigated the role of visual experience in the development of audiovisual and audiohaptic sound–shape associations (SSAs) using a unique set of five groups: individuals who had suffered a transient period of congenital blindness through congenital bilateral dense cataracts before undergoing cataract-reversal surgeries (CC group), individuals with a history of developmental cataracts (DC group), individuals with congenital permanent blindness (CB group), individuals with late permanent blindness (LB group), and controls with typical sight (TS group). Whereas the TS and LB groups showed highly robust SSAs, the CB, CC, and DC groups did not—in any of the modality combinations tested. These results provide evidence for a protracted sensitive period during which aberrant vision prevents SSA acquisition. Moreover, the finding of a systematic SSA in the LB group demonstrates that representations acquired during the sensitive period are resilient to loss despite dramatically changed experience. © The Author(s) 2019.","cataract; cross-modal correspondence; multisensory development; open data; open materials; sound–shape symbolism; visual deprivation","Adolescent; Adult; Auditory Perception; Blindness; Cataract Extraction; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motion; Vision, Ocular; Visual Cortex; Visual Perception; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; blindness; cataract extraction; child; female; hearing; human; male; middle aged; motion; physiology; vision; visual cortex; young adult","Bates D., Machler M., Bolker B., Walker S., Fitting linear mixed-effects models using lme4, Journal of Statistical Software, 67, 1, (2015); Bottari D., Kekunnaya R., Hense M., Troje N.F., Sourav S., Roder B., Motion processing after sight restoration: No competition between visual recovery and auditory compensation, NeuroImage, 167, pp. 284-296, (2018); Bottini R., Barilari M., Collignon O., Sound symbolism in sighted and blind: The role of vision and orthography in sound-shape correspondences, Cognition, 185, pp. 62-70, (2019); Bremner A.J., Caparos S., Davidoff J., de Fockert J., Linnell K.J., Spence C., Bouba” and “Kiki” in Namibia?

In the present study, we tested whether congenital deafness and/or the acquisition of a sign language alter the temporal processing characteristics of the visual system. Moreover, we investigated whether, assuming cross-modal plasticity in deaf individuals, the temporal processing characteristics of possibly reorganised auditory areas resemble those of the visual cortex. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) were recorded in congenitally deaf native signers, hearing native signers, and hearing nonsigners. The luminance of the visual stimuli was periodically modulated at 12, 21, and 40 Hz. For hearing nonsigners, the optimal driving rate was 12 Hz. By contrast, for the group of hearing signers, the optimal driving rate was 12 and 21 Hz, whereas for the group of deaf signers, the optimal driving rate was 21 Hz. We did not observe evidence for cross-modal recruitment of auditory cortex in the group of deaf signers. These results suggest a higher preferred neural processing rate as a consequence of the acquisition of a sign language. © 2022 The Authors.

However, in humans it is yet unknown which visual areas are shaped to which degree based on visual experience. The present study investigated the functional organization and processing capacities of early visual cortex in sight recovery individuals with either a history of congenital cataracts (CC) or late onset cataracts (developmental cataracts, DC). Visual event-related potentials (VERPs) were recorded to grating stimuli which were flashed in one of the four quadrants of the visual field. Participants had to detect rarely occurring grating orientations. The CC individuals showed the expected polarity reversal of the C1 wave between upper and lower visual field stimuli at the typical latency range. Since the C1 has been proposed to originate in the early retinotopic visual cortex, we concluded that one basic feature of the retinotopic organization, upper versus lower visual field organization, is spared in CC individuals. Group differences in the size and topography of the C1 effect, however, suggested a less precise functional tuning. The P1 wave, which has been associated with extrastriate visual cortex processing, was significantly attenuated in CC but not in DC individuals compared to typically sighted controls. The present study thus provides evidence for fundamental aspects of retinotopic processing in humans being independent of developmental vision. We suggest that visual impairments in sight recovery individuals may predominantly arise at higher cortical processing stages. © 2019 The Authors.","C1; Congenital cataract; Event-related potentials; Retinotopy; Sight recovery; Visual cortex; Visual development","Adolescent; Adult; Animals; Cataract; Cataract Extraction; Child; Electroencephalography; Female; Humans; Male; Recovery of Function; Retina; Vision Disorders; Visual Acuity; Visual Cortex; Visual Fields; Visual Pathways; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; animal; cataract; cataract extraction; child; convalescence; electroencephalography; female; human; male; pathophysiology; physiology; retina; visual acuity; visual cortex; visual disorder; visual field; visual system; young adult","Accornero N., Li Voti P., La Riccia M., Gregori B., Visual evoked potentials modulation during direct current cortical polarization, Experimental Brain Research, 178, 2, pp. 261-266, (2007); Aine C.J., Supek S., George J.S., Ranken D., Lewine J., Sanders J., Wood C.C., Retinotopic organization of human visual cortex: Departures from the classical model, Cerebral Cortex, 6, 3, pp. 354-361, (1996); Antal A., Kincses T.Z., Nitsche M.A., Bartfai O., Paulus W., Excitability changes induced in the human primary visual cortex by transcranial direct current stimulation: Direct electrophysiological evidence, Investigative Opthalmology & Visual Science, 45, 2, pp. 702-707, (2004); Arcaro M.J., Livingstone M.S., A hierarchical, retinotopic proto-organization of the primate visual system at birth, eLife, 6, (2017); Bavelier D., Neville H.J., Cross-modal plasticity: Where and how?

In the case of human deafness, for instance, it is known that visual, tactile or visuo-tactile stimuli can elicit a response within the auditory cortices. Nonetheless, both the timing of these evoked responses and the functional contribution of cross-modally recruited areas remain to be ascertained. In the present study, we examined to what extent auditory cortices of deaf humans participate in high-order visual processes, such as visual change detection. By measuring visual ERPs, in particular the visual MisMatch Negativity (vMMN), and performing source localization, we show that individuals with early deafness (N. = 12) recruit the auditory cortices when a change in motion direction during shape deformation occurs in a continuous visual motion stream. Remarkably this ""auditory"" response for visual events emerged with the same timing as the visual MMN in hearing controls (N. = 12), between 150 and 300. ms after the visual change. Furthermore, the recruitment of auditory cortices for visual change detection in early deaf was paired with a reduction of response within the visual system, indicating a shift from visual to auditory cortices of part of the computational process. The present study suggests that the deafened auditory cortices participate at extracting and storing the visual information and at comparing on-line the upcoming visual events, thus indicating that cross-modally recruited auditory cortices can reach this level of computation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Cross-modal plasticity; Deafness; Functional selectivity; MisMatch Negativity","Adult; Auditory Cortex; Deafness; Disease Progression; Female; Form Perception; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motion Perception; Nerve Net; Neuronal Plasticity; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time; Recruitment, Neurophysiological; Young Adult; adult; article; auditory cortex; auditory response; clinical article; controlled study; evoked visual response; female; hearing impairment; human; male; mismatch negativity; motion; priority journal; sound detection; vision; visual change detection; visual cortex; visual stimulation; visual system; auditory cortex; disease course; hearing impairment; middle aged; movement perception; nerve cell network; nerve cell plasticity; neurophysiological recruitment; pathophysiology; pattern recognition; photostimulation; procedures; randomized controlled trial; reaction time; young adult","Aguera P.-E., Jerbi K., Caclin A., Bertrand O., ELAN: a software package for analysis and visualization of MEG, EEG, and LFP signals, Comput.

A well-known consequence of congenital blindness in humans is the reduction of alpha activity which seems to go together with increased gamma activity during rest. These results have been interpreted as indicating a higher excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) ratio in visual cortex compared to normally sighted controls. Yet it is unknown whether the spectral profile of EEG during rest would recover if sight were restored. To test this question, the present study evaluated periodic and aperiodic components of the EEG resting state power spectrum. Previous research has linked the aperiodic components, which exhibit a power-law distribution and are operationalized as a linear fit of the spectrum in log-log space, to cortical E/I ratio. Moreover, by correcting for the aperiodic components from the power spectrum, a more valid estimate of the periodic activity is possible. Here we analyzed resting state EEG activity from two studies involving (1) 27 permanently congenitally blind adults (CB) and 27 age-matched normally sighted controls (MCB); (2) 38 individuals with reversed blindness due to bilateral, dense, congenital cataracts (CC) and 77 age-matched sighted controls (MCC). Based on a data driven approach, aperiodic components of the spectra were extracted for the low frequency (Lf-Slope 1.5 to 19.5 Hz) and high frequency (Hf-Slope 20 to 45 Hz) range. The Lf-Slope of the aperiodic component was significantly steeper (more negative slope), and the Hf-Slope of the aperiodic component was significantly flatter (less negative slope) in CB and CC participants compared to the typically sighted controls. Alpha power was significantly reduced, and gamma power was higher in the CB and the CC groups. These results suggest a sensitive period for the typical development of the spectral profile during rest and thus likely an irreversible change in the E/I ratio in visual cortex due to congenital blindness. We speculate that these changes are a consequence of impaired inhibitory circuits and imbalanced feedforward and feedback processing in early visual areas of individuals with a history of congenital blindness. © 2023","Alpha; Aperiodic activity; Congenital blindness; EEG resting state; Sight-recovery","Adult; Blindness; Cataract; Electroencephalography; Eye Abnormalities; Humans; Vision Disorders; Visual Cortex; adult; alpha rhythm; Article; BOLD signal; congenital blindness; congenital cataract; controlled study; electroencephalogram; evaluation study; female; gamma rhythm; human; major clinical study; male; oscillation; resting state network; spectroscopy; visual cortex; blindness; cataract; electroencephalography; eye malformation; visual cortex; visual disorder","Acharya J.N., Hani A.J., Cheek J., Thirumala P., Tsuchida T.N., American clinical neurophysiology society guideline 2: guidelines for standard electrode position nomenclature, Neurodiagn.

Here, the Size-Weight Illusion (SWI) was used to test whether visuo-haptic integration recovers after early visual deprivation. Normally sighted individuals perceive larger objects to be lighter than smaller objects of the same weight. In Experiment 1, individuals treated for dense bilateral congenital cataracts (who had no patterned visual experience at birth), individuals treated for developmental cataracts (who had patterned visual experience at birth, but were visually impaired), congenitally blind individuals and normally sighted individuals had to rate the weight of manually explored cubes that differed in size (Small, Medium, Large) across two possible weights (350 g, 700 g). In Experiment 2, individuals treated for dense bilateral congenital cataracts were compared to sighted individuals in a similar task using a string set-up, which removed haptic size cues. In both experiments, indistinguishable SWI effects were observed across all groups. These results provide evidence that early aberrant vision does not interfere with the development of the SWI, and suggest a recovery of the integration of size and weight cues provided by the visual and haptic modality. © 2021, The Author(s).","","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Perioperative Period; Sensory Deprivation; Size Perception; Treatment Outcome; Visual Acuity; Visual Perception; Visually Impaired Persons; Weight Perception; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; child; female; human; male; perception; perioperative period; sensory deprivation; treatment outcome; vision; visual acuity; visually impaired person; young adult","Birch E.E., Stager D., Leffler J., Weakley D., Early treatment of congenital unilateral cataract minimizes unequal competition, Investig.

However, the neurophysiological basis underlying these higher order perceptual dysfunctions have not been clearly identified. We assessed visual search performance using a novel virtual reality based task paired with eye tracking to simulate the exploration of a naturalistic scene (a virtual toy box). This was combined with electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and an analysis pipeline focusing on time frequency decomposition of alpha oscillatory activity. We found that individuals with CVI showed an overall impairment in visual search performance (as indexed by decreased success rate, as well as increased reaction time, visual search area, and gaze error) compared to controls with neurotypical development. Analysis of captured EEG activity following stimulus onset revealed that in the CVI group, there was a distinct lack of strong and well defined posterior alpha desynchronization; an important signal involved in the coordination of neural activity related to visual processing. Finally, an exploratory analysis revealed that in CVI, the magnitude of alpha desynchronization was associated with impaired visual search performance as well as decreased volume of specific thalamic nuclei implicated in visual processing. These results suggest that impairments in visuospatial processing related to visual search in CVI are associated with alterations in alpha band oscillations as well as early neurological injury at the level of visual thalamic nuclei. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","","Cognition; Electroencephalography; Humans; Reaction Time; Vision Disorders; Visual Perception; adolescent; adult; Article; brain development; brain size; cerebral visual impairment; clinical article; clinical assessment; cognition; controlled study; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography; exploratory research; eye tracking; female; human; male; morphometry; nerve stimulation; oscillation; outcome assessment; reaction time; thalamus nucleus; virtual reality; vision; visual acuity; visual impairment; visuomotor coordination; young adult; visual disorder","Aminoff M.J., Electrophysiology, (2007); Bell A.J., Sejnowski T.J., An information-maximization approach to blind separation and blind deconvolution, Neural Comput., 7, 6, pp. 1129-1159, (1995); Bennett C.R., Bailin E.S., Gottlieb T.K., Bauer C.M., Bex P.J., Merabet L.B., Virtual reality based assessment of static object visual search in ocular compared to cerebral visual impairment, HCI, 8, pp. 28-38, (2018); Bennett C.R., Bex P.J., Bauer C.M., Merabet L.B., The assessment of visual function and functional vision, Semin.

This result is often linked to the processing of peripheral targets, and it is assumed to occur in relation to attention orienting. We evaluated whether enhanced reactivity to visual events in profoundly deaf individuals can be explained by faster orienting of visual attention alone. Methods: We examined 11 deaf individuals and 11 hearing controls, in a simple detection task and in a shape discrimination task. While simple detection can be performed under distributed attention, shape discrimination requires orienting of spatial attention to the target. The same visual targets served for both tasks, presented at central or peripheral locations and corrected for cortical magnification. Results: The simple detection task revealed faster RTs in deaf than hearing controls, regardless of target location. Moreover, while hearing controls paid a cost in responding to peripheral than central targets, deaf participants performed equally well regardless of target eccentricity. In the shape discrimination task deaf never outperformed hearing controls. Conclusions: These findings reveal that enhanced reactivity to visual stimuli in the deaf cannot be explained only by faster orienting of visual attention and can emerge for centr l as well as peripheral targets. Moreover, the persisting advantage for peripheral locations in the deaf, observed here under distributed attention, suggests that this spatially-selective effect could result from reorganised sensory processing rather than different attentional gradients. © 2010 - IOS Press and the authors.

Such compression is pivotal for sound-object recognition. Here, we assessed whether computations subtending local and statistical representations of sounds could be distinguished at the neural level. A computational auditory model was employed to extract auditory statistics from natural sound textures (i.e., fire, rain) and to generate synthetic exemplars where local and statistical properties were controlled. Twenty-four human participants were passively exposed to auditory streams while the electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Each stream could consist of short, medium, or long sounds to vary the amount of acoustic information. Short and long sounds were expected to engage local or summary statistics representations, respectively. Data revealed a clear dissociation. Compared with summary-based ones, auditory-evoked responses based on local information were selectively greater in magnitude in short sounds. Opposite patterns emerged for longer sounds. Neural oscillations revealed that local features and summary statistics rely on neural activity occurring at different temporal scales, faster (beta) or slower (theta-alpha). These dissociations emerged automatically without explicit engagement in a discrimination task. Overall, this study demonstrates that the auditory system developed distinct coding mechanisms to discriminate changes in the acoustic environment based on fine structure and summary representations. © 2023, Society for Neuroscience.

In this study we investigated whether basic multisensory abilities are impaired in hearing-restored individuals with deafness acquired at different stages of development. To this aim, we tested congenitally and late deaf cochlear implant (CI) recipients, age-matched with two groups of hearing controls, on an audio-tactile redundancy paradigm, in which reaction times to unimodal and crossmodal redundant signals were measured. Our results showed that both congenitally and late deaf CI recipients were able to integrate audio-tactile stimuli, suggesting that congenital and acquired deafness does not prevent the development and recovery of basic multisensory processing. However, we found that congenitally deaf CI recipients had a lower multisensory gain compared to their matched controls, which may be explained by their faster responses to tactile stimuli. We discuss this finding in the context of reorganisation of the sensory systems following sensory loss and the possibility that these changes cannot be ""rewired"" through auditory reafferentation. © 2014 Nava et al.","","Adult; Cochlear Implants; Deafness; Female; Hearing; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Persons With Hearing Impairments; Reaction Time; Touch; Young Adult; adult; article; auditory discrimination; auditory stimulation; clinical article; cochlea prosthesis; congenital deafness; controlled study; female; hearing impairment; human; late deafness; male; middle aged; nerve cell plasticity; onset age; response time; stimulus response; tactile discrimination; tactile stimulation; young adult; Deafness; hearing; pathophysiology; patient; physiology; reaction time; touch","Wallace M.T., Stein B.E., Early experience determines how the senses will interact, Journal of Neurophysiology, 97, 1, pp. 921-926, (2007); Yu L., Rowland B.A., Stein B.E., Initiating the development of multisensory integration by manipulating sensory experience, J Neurosci, 30, pp. 4904-4913, (2010); Carriere B.N., Royal D.W., Perrault T.J., Morrison S.P., Vaughan J.W., Stein B.E., Wallace M.T., Visual deprivation alters the development of cortical multisensory integration, Journal of Neurophysiology, 98, 5, pp. 2858-2867, (2007); Wallace M.T., Perrault Jr. T.J., Hairston W.D., Stein B.E., Visual experience is necessary for the development of multisensory integration, Journal of Neuroscience, 24, 43, pp. 9580-9584, (2004); Putzar L., Goerendt I., Lange K., Rosler F., Roder B., Early visual deprivation impairs multisensory interactions in humans, Nature Neuroscience, 10, 10, pp. 1243-1245, (2007); Lewkowicz D.J., Ghazanfar A.A., The emergency of multisensory systems through perceptual narrowing, Trends Cogn Sci, 13, pp. 470-478, (2009); Lewkowicz D.J., Ghazanfar A.A., The decline of cross-species intersensory perception in human infants, P Natl Acad Sci U S a, 103, pp. 6771-6774, (2006); Putzar L., Hotting K., Roder B., Early visual deprivation affects the development of face recognition and of audio-visual speech perception, Restor Neurol Neurosci, 28, pp. 251-257, (2010); Putzar L., Gondan M., Roder B., Basic multisensory functions can be acquired after congenital visual pattern deprivation in humans, Dev Neuropsychol, 37, pp. 697-711, (2012); Tremblay C., Champoux F., Lepore F., Theoret H., Audiovisual fusion and cochlear implant proficiency, Restor Neurol Neurosci, 28, pp. 283-291, (2010); Schorr E.A., Fox N.A., Van Wassenhove V., Knudsen E.I., Auditory-visual fusion in speech perception in children with cochlear implants, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 102, 51, pp. 18748-18750, (2005); Gilley P.M., Sharma A., Mitchell T.V., Dorman M.F., The influence of a sensitive period for auditory-visual integration in children with cochlear implants, Restor Neurol Neurosci, 28, pp. 207-218, (2010); Pavani F., Roder B., Crossmodal plasticity as a consequence of sensory loss: Insights from blindness and deafness, The New Handbook of Multisensory Processes, pp. 737-760, (2012); Levanen S., Hamdorf D., Feeling vibrations: Enhanced tactile sensitivity in congenitally deaf humans, Neuroscience Letters, 301, 1, pp. 75-77, (2001); Landry S.P., Guillemot J.P., Champoux F., Temporary deafness can impair multisensory integration.

Correct and incorrect signed sentences were presented sign by sign on a computer screen. At the end of each sentence the participants had to judge whether or not the sentence was an appropriate DGS sentence. Two types of violations were introduced: (1) semantically incorrect sentences containing a selectional restriction violation (implausible object); (2) morphosyntactically incorrect sentences containing a verb that was incorrectly inflected (i.e., incorrect direction of movement). Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 74 scalp electrodes. Results: Semantic violations (implausible signs) elicited an N400 effect followed by a positivity. Sentences with a morphosyntactic violation (verb agreement violation) elicited a negativity followed by a broad centro-parietal positivity. Conclusions: ERP correlates of semantic and morphosyntactic aspects of DGS clearly differed from each other and showed a number of similarities with those observed in other signed and oral languages. These data suggest a similar functional organization of signed and oral languages despite the visual-spacial modality of sign language. © 2014 Hänel-Faulhaber et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Deaf; Event-related potentials; LAN; N400; Native signers; P600; Semantic violation; Sign language; Verb agreement","Adult; Brain; Cognition; Deafness; Evoked Potentials; Female; Germany; Humans; Male; Semantics; Sign Language; Statistics as Topic; Task Performance and Analysis; Young Adult; adult; article; clinical article; electrode; electroencephalogram; event related potential; female; hearing impairment; human; language; male; semantics; sign language; written language; brain; cognition; Deafness; evoked response; Germany; pathophysiology; physiology; semantics; statistics; task performance; young adult","Sandler W., Lillo-Martin D., Sign language and linguistic universals, (2006); Emmorey K., Language, cognition, and the brain: Insights from sign language research, (2002); Neville H.J., Coffey S.A., Lawson D.S., Fischer A., Emmorey K., Bellugi U., Neural systems mediating american sign language: effects of sensory experience and age of acquisition, Brain Lang, 57, 3, pp. 285-308, (1997); Newport E.L., Supalla T., Sign language research at the millennium, The Signs of Language Revisited: An Anthology in Honor of Ursula Bellugi and Edward Klima, pp. 103-114, (2000); Rathmann C., Mathur G., Is verb agreement different cross-modally?, Modality and structure in signed and spoken languages, pp. 370-404, (2002); Crain S., Lillo-Martin D., An introduction to linguistic theory and language acquisition, (1999); Hanel B., Der Erwerb der Deutschen Gebärdensprache als Erstsprache: Die frühkindliche Sprachentwicklung von Subjekt- und Objektverbkongruenz in DGS, (2005); Campbell R., MacSweeney M., Waters D., Sign language and the brain: a review, J Deaf Stud Deaf Educ, 13, 1, pp. 3-20, (2008); MacSweeney M., Capek C.M., Campbell R., Woll B., The signing brain: the neurobiology of sign language, Trends Cogn Sci, 12, 11, pp. 432-440, (2008); Neville H.J., Bavelier D., Neural organization and plasticity of language, Curr Opin Neurobiol, 8, 2, pp. 254-258, (1998); Newman A.J., Bavelier D., Corina D., Jezzard P., Neville H.J., A critical period for right hemisphere recruitment in American sign language processing, Nat Neurosci, 5, pp. 76-80, (2002); MacSweeney M., Woll B., Campbell R., McGuire P.K., David A.S., Williams S.C.R., Suckling J., Calvert G.A., Brammer M.J., Neural systems underlying British sign language and audio-visual English processing in native users, Brain, 125, 7, pp. 1583-1593, (2002); Hagoort P., Brown C., Groothusen J., The syntactic positive shift (SPS) as an ERP measure of syntactic processing, Language and cognitive processes, 8, 4, pp. 439-483, (1993); Osterhout L., On the brain response to syntactic anomalies: manipulations of word position and word class reveal individual differences, Brain Lang, 59, 3, pp. 494-522, (1997); Hahne A., Friederici A.D., Electrophysiological evidence for two steps in syntactic analysis.

Temporary and permanent visual deprivations remain pivotal approaches for studying the degree of experience-dependent plasticity of sensory functions. Natural models and experimental manipulations of visual experiences have contributed to uncovering some of the guiding principles that characterize transitions of plastic potentials in the human visual system. The existing literature regarding the neural plasticity associated with visual systems has been extensively discussed by two recent reviews articles (Röder et al., 2020; Castaldi et al., 2020) which provided an overview of different models of study and methods of investigations, gathering insights on both developing and adult brains.

Ten prelingually and four postlingually deafened adults who received a unilateral CI were tested in a sound-source identification task. Above chance performance was observed in those prelingual CI recipients who had worn their implant for longer time (9 years on average), revealing some monaural sound localisation abilities in this population but only after extensive CI use. On the contrary, the four postlingual recipients performed equal or better with respect to the best prelingual participants despite shorter experience with the monaural implant (11 months on average). Our findings reveal that some sound localisation ability can emerge in prelingually deafened adults fitted with a single implant, at least in a controlled laboratory setting. This ability, however, appears to emerge only after several years of CI use. Furthermore, the results of four postlingually deafened adults suggest that early experience with auditory cues may result in more rapid acquisition of spatial hearing with a single CI. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Patients who had experienced a transient period of congenital visual deprivation due to bilateral dense cataracts (congenital cataract, cc) have shown, after visual re-afferentation, deficits in a number of higher visual functions including global motion and face processing. By contrast, biological motion (BM) perception seemed to be spared. The present study investigated the neural correlates of BM processing in a sample of 12 congenital cataract-reversal individuals who had underwent visual restoration surgery at the age of a few months up to several years. The individual threshold for extracting BM from noise was assessed in a behavioral task while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in response to point-light displays of a walking man and of a scrambled version of the same stimuli. The threshold of the cc group at detecting BM did not differ from that of a group of matched controls (mc). In both groups, the N1 was modulated by BM. These largely unimpaired neural responses to BM stimuli together with a lack of behavioral group differences suggest that, in contrast to the neural systems for faces the neural systems for BM processing specialize independent of early visual input. © 2015.","Biological motion;

Ten profoundly deaf participants judged which of the two visual stimuli appearing on opposite sides of central fixation was delivered first. Stimuli were presented either symmetrically, at central or peripheral locations, or asymmetrically (i.e. one central and the other peripheral) at varying stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) using the method of constant stimuli. Two groups of hearing controls were also tested in this task: 10 hearing controls auditory-deprived during testing and 12 hearing controls who were not subjected to any deprivation procedure. Temporal order thresholds (i.e. just noticeable differences) and points of subjective simultaneity for the two visual stimuli did not differ between groups. However, faster discrimination responses were systematically observed in the deaf than in either group of hearing controls, especially when the first of the two stimuli appeared at peripheral locations. Contrary to some previous findings, our results show that a life-long auditory deprivation does not alter temporal processing abilities in the millisecond range. In fact, we show that deaf participants obtain similar temporal thresholds to hearing controls, while also responding much faster.

However, whether multisensory processing is affected by auditory deprivation has often remained largely overlooked. To fill this gap, we investigated the consequences of a profound auditory deprivation from birth on visuo-tactile processing. While the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded, dynamic visuo-tactile stimuli with a congruent or an incongruent motion direction were presented to a group of congenitally deaf native signers (N = 21) and matched hearing controls (N = 21). Standard stimuli were moving continuously for 200 ms either upwards or downwards, whereas the motion of deviant stimuli was interrupted in one of the two modalities. Participants were asked to detect deviant stimuli, moving in a predefined direction while ignoring deviants moving in the non-target direction. Behaviorally, deaf individuals committed more false alarms than hearing controls in the incongruent condition, that is, they responded more often when deviants moved in the non-target motion direction. ERPs (140–164 ms) of the deaf group were more anteriorly distributed for the visuo-tactile stimulation in comparison to hearing controls. Moreover, visuo-tactile motion congruency effects emerged with a later latency in the deaf group (350–450 ms) than in the hearing control group (200–280 ms). These findings suggest altered selection strategies and neural correlates for visuo-tactile motion processing as a result of congenital deafness. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Deafness; ERP; Multisensory processing; Neuroplasticity","Deafness; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials; Hearing; Humans; Touch; adult; Article; congenital deafness; controlled study; electroencephalography; event related potential; female; human; information processing; latent period; left hemisphere; male; right hemisphere; tactile stimulation; visual stimulation; visuo-tactile motion processing; evoked response; hearing; hearing impairment; physiology; touch","Allman B.L., Keniston L.P., Meredith M.A., Adult deafness induces somatosensory conversion of ferret auditory cortex, Proc.

Improvement of visual performance as a consequence of auditory deprivation is assumed to result from cross-modal changes occurring in late stages of visual processing. Here we measured reaction times and event-related potentials (ERPs) in profoundly deaf adults and hearing controls during a speeded visual detection task, to assess to what extent the enhanced reactivity of deaf individuals could reflect plastic changes in the early cortical processing of the stimulus. We found that deaf subjects were faster than hearing controls at detecting the visual targets, regardless of their location in the visual field (peripheral or peri-foveal). This behavioural facilitation was associated with ERP changes starting from the first detectable response in the striate cortex (C1 component) at about 80 ms after stimulus onset, and in the P1 complex (100-150 ms). In addition, we found that P1 peak amplitudes predicted the response times in deaf subjects, whereas in hearing individuals visual reactivity and ERP amplitudes correlated only at later stages of processing. These findings show that long-term auditory deprivation can profoundly alter visual processing from the earliest cortical stages.

The multisensory temporal binding window defines the time range within which two stimuli of different sensory modalities are merged into one percept and has been shown to depend on training. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of the training procedure for improving multisensory temporal discrimination and to test for a possible transfer of training to other multisensory tasks. Participants were trained over five sessions in a two-alternative forced-choice simultaneity judgment task. The task difficulty of each trial was either at each participant's threshold (adaptive group) or randomly chosen (control group). A possible transfer of improved multisensory temporal discrimination on multisensory binding was tested with a redundant signal paradigm in which the temporal alignment of auditory and visual stimuli was systematically varied. Moreover, the size of the spatial audio-visual ventriloquist effect was assessed. Adaptive training resulted in faster improvements compared to the control condition. Transfer effects were found for both tasks: The processing speed of auditory inputs and the size of the ventriloquist effect increased in the adaptive group following the training. We suggest that the relative precision of the temporal and spatial features of a cross-modal stimulus is weighted during multisensory integration. Thus, changes in the precision of temporal processing are expected to enhance the likelihood of multisensory integration for temporally aligned cross-modal stimuli.

Whether MD elicits neural changes beyond visual processing is yet unclear. Here, we assessed the specific impact of MD on neural correlates of multisensory processes. Neural oscillations associated with visual and audio-visual processing were measured for both the deprived and the non-deprived eye. Results revealed that MD changed neural activities associated with visual and multisensory processes in an eye-specific manner. Selectively for the deprived eye, alpha synchronization was reduced within the first 150 ms of visual processing. Conversely, gamma activity was enhanced in response to audio-visual events only for the non-deprived eye within 100–300 ms after stimulus onset. The analysis of gamma responses to unisensory auditory events revealed that MD elicited a crossmodal upweight for the non-deprived eye. Distributed source modeling suggested that the right parietal cortex played a major role in neural effects induced by MD. Finally, visual and audio-visual processing alterations emerged for the induced component of the neural oscillations, indicating a prominent role of feedback connectivity. Results reveal the causal impact of MD on both unisensory (visual and auditory) and multisensory (audio-visual) processes and, their frequency-specific profiles. These findings support a model in which MD increases excitability to visual events for the deprived eye and audio-visual and auditory input for the non-deprived eye. © 2023","Crossomdal; EEG; Monocular deprivation; Multisensory; Neural oscillations; Neural plasticity","Adult; Humans; Neuronal Plasticity; Sensory Deprivation; Vision, Monocular; Visual Cortex; Visual Perception; article; electroencephalogram; excitability; eye; gamma rhythm; human; monocular deprivation; nerve cell plasticity; oscillation; parietal cortex; vision; adult; monocular vision; nerve cell plasticity; physiology; sensory deprivation; visual cortex","Balz J., Keil J., Roa Romero Y., Mekle R., Schubert F., Aydin S., Ittermann B., Gallinat J., Senkowski D., GABA concentration in superior temporal sulcus predicts gamma power and perception in the sound-induced flash illusion, Neuroimage, 125, pp. 724-730, (2016); Bednaya E., Pavani F., Ricciardi E., Pietrini P., Bottari D., Oscillatory signatures of Repetition Suppression and Novelty Detection reveal altered induced visual responses in early deafness, Cortex, (2021); Bell A.J., Sejnowski T.J., An information-maximization approach to blind separation and blind deconvolution, Neural Comput., 7, pp. 1129-1159, (1995); Bhattacharya J., Shams L., Shimojo S., Sound-induced illusory flash perception: role of gamma band responses, Neuroreport, 13, pp. 1727-1730, (2002); Binda P., Kurzawski J.W., Lunghi C., Biagi L., Tosetti M., Morrone M.C., Response to short-term deprivation of the human adult visual cortex measured with 7T bold, Elife, 7, pp. 1-25, (2018); Bottari D., Bednaya E., Dormal G., Villwock A., Dzhelyova M., Grin K., Pietrini P., Ricciardi E., Rossion B., Roder B., EEG frequency-tagging demonstrates increased left hemispheric involvement and crossmodal plasticity for face processing in congenitally deaf signers, Neuroimage, 223, (2020); Bottari D., Kekunnaya R., Hense M., Troje N.F., Sourav S., Roder B., Motion processing after sight restoration: no competition between visual recovery and auditory compensation, Neuroimage, 167, pp. 284-296, (2018); Bottari D., Troje N.F., Ley P., Hense M., Kekunnaya R., Roder B., Sight restoration after congenital blindness does not reinstate alpha oscillatory activity in humans, Sci.

Consequently, late-treated individuals (> 5 months of age) with dense congenital bilateral cataracts (CC) exhibit poorer visual function recovery compared to individuals with bilateral developmental cataracts (DC). Reliable methods to differentiate between patients with congenital and developmental cataracts are often lacking, impeding efficient rehabilitation management and introducing confounds in clinical and basic research on recovery prognosis and optimal timing of surgery. A persistent reduction of the P1 wave of visual event-related potentials (VERPs), associated with extrastriate visual cortical activity, has been reported in CC but not in DC individuals. Using two experiments, this study developed and validated P1-based biomarkers for diagnosing a history of congenital blindness in cataract-reversal individuals. Methods: Congenital and developmental cataract-reversal individuals as well as typically sighted matched controls took part in a first experiment used for exploring an electrophysiological biomarker (NCC = 13, NDC = 13, NControl = 26). Circular stimuli containing gratings were presented in one of the visual field quadrants while visual event-related potentials (VERPs) were recorded. Two biomarkers were derived from the P1 wave of the VERP: (1) The mean of the normalized P1 amplitude at posterior electrodes, and (2) a classifier obtained from a linear support vector machine (SVM). A second experiment with partially new CC/DC individuals and their matched controls (NCC = 14, NDC = 15, NControl = 29) was consecutively used to validate the classification based on both biomarkers. Performance of the classifiers were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. All cataract-reversal individuals were tested after at least one year of vision recovery. Findings: The normalized P1 amplitude over posterior electrodes allowed a successful classification of the CC from the DC individuals and typically sighted controls (area under ROC curve, AUC = 0.803 and 0.929 for the normalized P1 amplitude and the SVM-based biomarker, respectively). The validation for both biomarkers in experiment 2 again resulted in a high classification success (AUC = 0.800 and 0.883, respectively for the normalized P1 amplitude and the SVM-based biomarker). In the most conservative scenario involving classification of CC from DC individuals in a group of only cataract-reversal individuals, excluding typically sighted controls, the SVM-based biomarker was found to be superior to the mean P1 amplitude based biomarker (AUC = 0.852 compared to 0.757 for the mean P1 based biomarker in validation). Minimum specificity obtained was 80% across all biomarkers. Interpretation: A persistent reduction of the P1 wave provides a highly specific method for classifying cataract patients post-surgically as having suffered from bilateral congenital vs. bilateral developmental cataracts. We suggest that using the P1 based non-invasive electrophysiological biomarker will augment existing clinical classification criteria for individuals with a history of bilateral congenital cataracts, aiding clinical and basic research, recovery prognosis, and rehabilitation efforts.

Until now, research focused exclusively on covert attentional orienting, neglecting whether overt oculomotor behavior may also change in deaf people. Here we used the pro- and anti-saccade task to examine the relative contribution of reflexive and voluntary eye-movement control in profoundly deaf and hearing individuals. We observed a behavioral facilitation in reflexive compared to voluntary eye movements, indexed by faster saccade latencies and smaller error rates in pro- than anti-saccade trials, which was substantially larger in deaf than hearing participants. This provides the first evidence of plastic changes related to deafness in overt oculomotor behavior, and constitutes an ecologically relevant parallel to the modulations attributed to deafness in covert attention orienting. Our findings also have implications for designers of real and virtual environments for deaf people and reveal that experiments on deaf visual abilities must not ignore the prominent reflexive eye-movement orienting in this sensory-deprived population. © 2012 Copyright 2012 Psychology Press, an imprint of the Taylor & Francis Group, an Informa business.","Cortical plasticity; Deafness; Eye movements","accuracy; adult; article; behavior; clinical article; controlled study; female; hearing impairment; human; latent period; male; profound deafness; reflexive eye movement; saccadic eye movement; task performance; visual orientation; voluntary movement","Agrafiotis D., Canagarajah N., Bull D.R., Kyle J., Seers H., Dye M., A perceptually optimised video coding system for sign language communication at low bit rates, Signal Processing: Image Communication, 21, 7, pp. 531-549, (2006); Bavelier D., Dye M.W., Hauser P.C., Do deaf individuals see better?, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 10, 11, pp. 512-518, (2006); Bavelier D., Neville H.J., Cross-modal plasticity: Where and how?, Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 3, 6, pp. 443-452, (2002); Bosworth R.G., Dobkins K.R., The effects of spatial attention on motion processing in deaf signers, hearing signers, and hearing nonsigners, Brain and Cognition, 49, 1, pp. 152-169, (2002); Bottari D., Nava E., Ley P., Pavani F., Enhanced reactivity to visual stimuli in deaf individuals, Restorative Neurology and Neuroscience, 28, 2, pp. 167-179, (2010); Brainard D.H., The Psychophysics Toolbox, Spatial Vision, 10, pp. 433-436, (1997); Chen Q., Zhang M., Zhou X., Effects of spatial distribution of attention during inhibition of return (IOR) on flanker interference in hearing and congenitally deaf people, Brain Research, 1109, 1, pp. 117-127, (2006); Colmenero J.M., Catena A., Fuentes L.J., Ramos M.M., Mechanisms of visuo-spatial orienting in deafness, European Journal of Cognitive Psychology, 16, pp. 791-805, (2004); Dye M.W., Hauser P.C., Bavelier D., Is visual selective attention in deaf individuals enhanced or deficient?

Although CIs are the most successful neural prosthesis to date, some CI users still do not achieve satisfactory outcomes using these devices. To explain variability in outcomes, clinicians and researchers have increasingly focused their attention on neuroscientific investigations that examined how the auditory cortices respond to the electric signals that originate from the CI. This chapter provides an overview of the literature that examined how the auditory cortex changes its functional properties in response to inputs from the CI, in animal models and in humans. We focus first on the basic responses to sounds delivered through electrical hearing and, next, we examine the integrity of two fundamental aspects of the auditory system: tonotopy and processing of binaural cues. When addressing the effects of CIs in humans, we also consider speech-evoked responses. We conclude by discussing to what extent this neuroscientific literature can contribute to clinical practices and help to overcome variability in outcomes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Auditory cortex; Cochlear implants; Deafness; Sensitive periods; Speech","Animals; Auditory Cortex; Cochlear Implantation; Cochlear Implants; Humans; Neuronal Plasticity; Speech Perception; animal; auditory cortex; cochlea prosthesis; cochlear implantation; human; nerve cell plasticity; physiology; speech perception","Aiken S.J., Picton T.W., Envelope and spectral frequency-following responses to vowel sounds, Hear Res, 245, pp. 35-47, (2008); Anderson C.A., Lazard D.S., Hartley D.E., Plasticity in bilateral superior temporal cortex: effects of deafness and cochlear implantation on auditory and visual speech processing, Hear Res, 343, pp. 138-149, (2017); Anderson C.A., Wiggins I.M., Kitterick P.T., Et al., Adaptive benefit of cross-modal plasticity following cochlear implantation in deaf adults, Proc Natl Acad Sci, 114, pp. 10256-10261, (2017); Anniko M., Sjostrom B., Webster D., The effects of auditory deprivation on morphological maturation of the ventral cochlear nucleus, Arch Otorhinolaryngol, 246, pp. 43-47, (1989); Baker C.A., Montey K.L., Pongstaporn T., Et al., Postnatal development of the endbulb of held in congenitally deaf cats, Front Neuroanat, 4, (2010); Barone P., Lacassagne L., Kral A., Reorganization of the connectivity of cortical field DZ in congenitally deaf cat, PLoS One, 8, (2013); Bavelier D., Neville H.J., Cross-modal plasticity: where and how?, Nat Rev Neurosci, 3, pp. 443-452, (2002); Bednaya E., Pavani F., Ricciardi E., Et al., Oscillatory signatures of repetition suppression and novelty detection reveal altered induced visual responses in early deafness, Cortex, 142, pp. 138-153, (2021); Berger C., Kuhne D., Scheper V., Et al., Congenital deafness affects deep layers in primary and secondary auditory cortex, J Comp Neurol, 525, (2017); Bottari D., Berto M., Three factors to characterize plastic potential transitions in the visual system, Neurosci Biobehav.

The study of rare individuals whose sight was restored after a period of congenital blindness offers the rare opportunity to assess whether early visual input is a prerequisite for the full development of auditory functions in humans as well. Here, we investigated whether a few months of delayed visual onset would affect the development of Auditory Brainstem Responses (ABRs). ABRs are widely used in the clinical practice to assess both functionality and development of the subcortical auditory pathway and, provide reliable data at the individual level. We collected Auditory Brainstem Responses from two case studies, young children (both having less than 5 years of age) who experienced a transient visual deprivation since birth due to congenital bilateral dense cataracts (BC), and who acquired sight at about two months of age. As controls, we tested 41 children (sighted controls, SC) with typical development, as well as two children who were treated (at about two months of age) for congenital monocular cataracts (MC). The SC group data served to predict, at the individual level, wave latencies of each BC and MC participant. Statistics were performed both at the single subject as well as at the group levels on latencies of main ABR waves (I, III, V and SN10). Results revealed delayed response latencies for both BC children compared with the SC group starting from the wave III. Conversely, no difference emerged between MC children and the SC group. These findings suggest that in case the onset of patterned visual input is delayed, the functional development of the subcortical auditory pathway lags behind typical developmental trajectories. Ultimately results are in favor of the presence of a crossmodal sensitive period in the human subcortical auditory system. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","ABR; Auditory brainstem responses; Auditory pathway development; Case studies; Congenital bilateral dense cataracts; Sight-recovery","Animals; Auditory Pathways; Auditory Threshold; Child, Preschool; Evoked Potentials, Auditory, Brain Stem; Hearing; Humans; Reaction Time; Vision Disorders; Article; auditory nervous system; brain stem response; case study; cataract extraction; child; clinical article; clinical practice; congenital bilateral dense cataract; congenital cataract; congenital monocular cataract; controlled study; convalescence; evoked brain stem auditory response; hearing; human; infant; latent period; male; pediatric patient; prediction; preschool child; reaction time; vision; visual field defect; animal; auditory nervous system; auditory threshold; physiology; visual disorder","Bartha-Doering L., Alexopoulos J., Giordano V., Stelzer L., Kainz T., Benavides-Varela S., Wartenburger I., Klebermass-Schrehof K., Olischar M., Seidl R., Berger A., Absence of neural speech discrimination in preterm infants at term-equivalent age, Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience, 39, (2019); Battal C., Occelli V., Bertonati G., Falagiarda F., Collignon O., General enhancement of spatial hearing in congenitally blind people, Psychol.

While normal development of global motion perception seems to require visual input during an early sensitive period, the detection of biological motion (BM) does not seem to do so. A more complex form of BM processing is the identification of human actions. Here, we tested whether identification rather than detection of BM is experience dependent. A group of human participants who had been treated for congenital cataracts (CC; of up to 18 years in duration, CC group) had to identify ten actions performed by human line figures. In addition, they performed a coherent motion (CM) detection task, which required identifying the direction of CM amid the movement of random dots. As controls, developmental cataract (DC) reversal individuals (DC group) who had undergone the same surgical treatment as CC group were included. Moreover, normally sighted controls were tested both with vision blurred to match the visual acuity (VA) of CC individuals [vision matched (VM) group] and with full sight [sighted control (SC) group]. The CC group identified biological actions with an extraordinary high accuracy (on average ~85% correct) and was indistinguishable from the VM control group. By contrast, CM processing impairments of the CC group persisted even after controlling for VA. These results in the same individuals demonstrate an impressive resilience of BM processing to aberrant early visual experience and at the same time a sensitive period for the development of CM processing. © 2020 Rajendran et al.","Biological action;

Moreover, it has been shown that ""heteromodal"" and ""sensory-specific"" cortices are involved in cross-modal integration. Thus, the second aim of the present study was to examine whether audiovisual integration influences visual detection in patients with different cortical lesions responsible of different kinds of visual disorders. More specifically, we investigated cross-modal, audiovisual integration in patients with visual impairment due to a visual field deficit (e.g., hemianopia) or visuospatial attentional deficit (e.g., neglect) and patients with both hemianopia and neglect. Patients were asked to detect visual stimuli presented alone or in combination with auditory stimuli that could be spatially aligned or not with the visual ones. The results showed an enhancement of visual detection in cross-modal condition (spatially aligned condition) comparing to unimodal visual condition only in patients with hemianopia or neglect; by contrast, the multisensory integration did not occur when patients presented both deficits. These data suggest that patients with visual disorders can enormously benefit the multisensory integration. Moreover, they showed a different influence of cortical lesion on multisensory integration. Thus, the present results show the important adaptive meaning of multisensory integration and are very promising with respect to the possibility of recovery from visual and spatial impairments. © 2005 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","","Acoustic Stimulation; Aged; Analysis of Variance; Attention; Auditory Perception; Cerebral Cortex; Female; Humans; Male; Perceptual Disorders; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time; Retrospective Studies; Signal Detection (Psychology); Spatial Behavior; Visual Perception; adult; aged; article; attention deficit disorder; auditory stimulation; brain cortex lesion; clinical article; controlled study; depth perception; female; hemianopia; human; male; perception; priority journal; vision; visual disorder; visual field defect; visual stimulation","Azzopardi P., Cowey A., Blindsight and visual awareness, Consciousness and Cognition, 7, pp. 292-311, (1998); Bolognini N., Frassinetti F., Serino A., Ladavas E., Acoustical vision of below threshold stimuli: Interaction among spatially converging audiovisual inputs, Experimental Brain Research, 160, pp. 273-282, (2005); Buxbaum L.J., Ferraro M.K., Veramonti T., Farne A., Whyte J., Ladavas E., Frassinetti F., Coslett H.B., Hemispatial neglect: Subtypes, neuroanatomy, and disability, Neurology, 62, pp. 749-756, (2004); Calvert G.A., Brammer M., Bullmore E.T., Campbell R., Iversen S.D., David A.S., Response amplification in sensory-specific cortices during crossmodal binding, NeuroReport, 10, pp. 2619-2623, (1999); Calvert G.A., Campbell R., Brammer M.J., Evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging of crossmodal binding in the human heteromodal cortex, Current Biology, 10, pp. 649-657, (2000); Calvert G.A., Hansen P.C., Iversen S.D., Brammer M.J., Detection of multisensory integration sites by application of electrophysiological criteria to the BOLD response, Neuroimage, 14, pp. 427-438, (2001); Damasio H., Damasio A.R., Lesion Analysis in Neuropsychology, (1989); Frassinetti F., Bolognini N., Ladavas E., Enhancement of visual perception by crossmodal visuo-auditory interaction, Experimental Brain Research, 147, pp. 332-343, (2002); Frassinetti F., Pavani F., Ladavas E., Acoustic vision of neglected stimuli: Interaction among spatially converging audiovisual inputs in neglect patients, Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 14, pp. 62-64, (2002); Gauthier L., Dehaut F., Joanette Y., The bells' test: A quantitative and qualitative test for visual neglect, International Journal of Clinical Neuropsychology, 11, pp. 49-54, (1989); Giard M.H., Peronnet F., Auditory-visual integration during multimodal object recognition in humans: A behavioral and electrophysiological study, Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 11, pp. 473-490, (1999); Halligan P.W., Fink G.R., Marshall J.C., Vallar G., Spatial cognition: Evidence from visual neglect, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 7, pp. 125-133, (2003); Husain M., Rorden C., Non-spatially lateralised mechanism in hemispatial neglect, Nature Neuroscience Review, 4, pp. 26-36, (2003); Jay M.F., Sparks D.L., Sensorimotor integration in the primate superior colliculus: II.

Nineteen profoundly deaf participants, 22 cochlear implant recipients and 18 hearing controls were asked to detect a change occurring between two consecutive visual scenes separated by a blank. Changes occurred on half of the trials, either at central or peripheral locations, and the task was performed under focused attention (at the centre or at the periphery) or under distributed attention. When allowed to focus attention, all groups showed comparable change sensitivity, with better performance for central than peripheral stimuli. However, in the distributed condition, only the profoundly deaf participants remained reliably more sensitive to changes occurring at central than peripheral locations. This finding contradicts the well-known visual performance enhancement typically observed for peripheral regions of the visual field in the profoundly deaf. We suggest that this discrepancy between our novel finding and the existing literature reflects the strictly endogenous nature of our change blindness paradigm. Our results point to a differential role of exogenous and endogenous attention components in the multisensory plasticity occurring after auditory deprivation and suggest that compensatory abilities in the deaf may be linked to exogenous capture of visual attention. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, there are only a few studies that directly addressed the effect of congenital visual deprivation in color perception in humans. Objective: The goal of the current study was to assess the effect of congenital visual deprivation on color vision using a panel based color arrangement test. Methods: We investigated the recovery of color vision using the Farnsworth D15 test in a group of individuals who had experienced visual deprivation since birth due to bilateral dense congenital cataracts before undergoing cataract-reversal surgery (Congenital cataract, CC, n=12). In addition, we tested two groups of control participants: (1) individuals who had had non-dense congenital cataract or developed cataract later in their childhood (Developmental cataract, DC, n=10), and (2) sighted controls with normal or corrected to normal vision (n=14). Based on the methods proposed by Vingrys and King-Smith (1988), we derived the following metrics of color vision performance: (1) total error score, (2) confusion index, (3) confusion angle, and (4) selectivity index. Results: All of the measured indices of color vision performance were unaltered by a period of congenital visual deprivation. Conclusions: Our results support the view that, development of visual functions such as color discrimination and color arrangement does not depend on typical visual experience during a sensitive phase in early childhood. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

We tested the neural processing of faces in 11 humans who had been blind from birth and had undergone cataract surgery between 2 mo and 14 y of age. Pictures of faces and houses, scrambled versions of these pictures, and pictures of butterflies were presented while event-related potentials were recorded. Participants had to respond to the pictures of butterflies (targets) only. All participants, even those who had been blind from birth for several years, were able to categorize the pictures and to detect the targets. In healthy controls and in a group of visually impaired individuals with a history of developmental or incomplete congenital cataracts, the well-known enhancement of the N170 (negative peak around 170 ms) event-related potential to faces emerged, but a face-sensitive response was not observed in humans with a history of congenital dense cataracts. By contrast, this group showed a similar N170 response to all visual stimuli, which was indistinguishable from the N170 response to faces in the controls. The face-sensitive N170 response has been associated with the structural encoding of faces. Therefore, these data provide evidence for the hypothesis that the functional differentiation of category-specific neural representations in humans, presumably involving the elaboration of inhibitory circuits, is dependent on experience and linked to a sensitive period. Such functional specialization of neural systems seems necessary to archive high processing proficiency.","","Adolescent; Adult; Blindness; Cataract; Child; Face; Female; Humans; Male; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Visual Perception; adolescent; article; cataract extraction; child; clinical article; congenital blindness; congenital cataract; controlled study; event related potential; face; face development; female; human; infant; preschool child; priority journal; school child; vision; visual acuity; visual deprivation; visual field defect; visual impairment; visual stimulation","Knudsen E.I., Sensitive periods in the development of the brain and behavior, J Cogn Neurosci, 16, 8, pp. 1412-1425, (2004); Lewis T.L., Maurer D., Multiple sensitive periods in human visual development: Evidence from visually deprived children, Dev Psychobiol, 46, 3, pp. 163-183, (2005); Wiesel T.N., Hubel D.H., Comparison of the effects of unilateral and bilateral eye closure on cortical unit responses in kittens, J Neurophysiol, 28, 6, pp. 1029-1040, (1965); Stevens C., Neville H., Specificity of experiential effects in neurocognitive development, The Cognitive Neurosciences v; Roder B., Sensory deprivaton and the development of multisensory integration, Multisensory Development, pp. 301-324, (2012); Robbins R.A., Nishimura M., Mondloch C.J., Lewis T.L., Maurer D., Deficits in sensitivity to spacing after early visual deprivation in humans: A comparison of human faces, monkey faces, and houses, Dev Psychobiol, 52, 8, pp. 775-781, (2010); Putzar L., Hotting K., Roder B., Early visual deprivation affects the development of face recognition and of audio-visual speech perception, Restor Neurol Neurosci, 28, 2, pp. 251-257, (2010); Putzar L., Hotting K., Rosler F., Roder B., The development of visual feature binding processes after visual deprivation in early infancy, Vision Res, 47, 20, pp. 2616-2626, (2007); Putzar L., Goerendt I., Lange K., Rosler F., Roder B., Early visual deprivation impairs multisensory interactions in humans, Nat Neurosci, 10, 10, pp. 1243-1245, (2007); Putzar L., Gondan M., Roder B., Basic multisensory functions can be acquired after congenital visual pattern deprivation in humans, Dev Neuropsychol, 37, 8, pp. 697-711, (2012); Hadad B.S., Maurer D., Lewis T.L., Long trajectory for the development of sensitivity to global and biological motion, Dev Sci, 14, 6, pp. 1330-1339, (2011); Geldart S., Mondloch C.J., Maurer D., De Schonen S., Brent H.P., The effect of early visual deprivation on the development of face processing, Dev Sci, 5, 4, pp. 490-501, (2002); Maurer D., Mondloch C.J., Sensitive periods in face perceptioin, The Oxford Handbook of Face Perception, pp. 779-796, (2011); Werker J.C., Tees R.C., Cross-language speech perception: Evidence for perceptual reorganization during the first year of life, Infant Behav Dev, 7, pp. 49-63, (1984); Lewkowicz D.J., Ghazanfar A.A., The emergence of multisensory systems through perceptual narrowing, Trends Cogn Sci, 13, 11, pp. 470-478, (2009); Cantlon J.F., Pinel P., Dehaene S., Pelphrey K.A., Cortical representations of symbols, objects, and faces are pruned back during early childhood, Cereb Cortex, 21, 1, pp. 191-199, (2011); Putzar L., Et al., The neural basis of lip-reading capabilities is altered by early visual deprivation, Neuropsychologia, 48, 7, pp. 2158-2166, (2010); Le Grand R., Mondloch C.J., Maurer D., Brent H.P., Neuroperception.

To test whether there is a sensitive phase in the first years of life during which visual input is crucial for the acquisition of this remapping process, we tested a single case of a congenitally blind man whose sight was restored after the age of two years. HS performed a tactile temporal order judgment task (TOJ) which required judging the temporal order of two tactile stimuli, one presented to each index finger. In addition, a visual-tactile cross-modal congruency task was run, in which spatially congruent and spatially incongruent visual distractor stimuli were presented together with tactile stimuli. The tactile stimuli had to be localized. Both tasks were performed with an uncrossed and a crossed hand posture. Similar to congenitally blind individuals HS did not show a crossing effect in the tactile TOJ task suggesting an anatomical rather than visual-external coding of touch. In the visual-tactile task, however, external remapping of touch was observed though incomplete compared to sighted controls.These data support the hypothesis of a sensitive phase for the acquisition of an automatic use of visual-spatial representations for coding tactile input. Nonetheless, these representations seem to be acquired to some extent after the end of congenital blindness but seem to be recruited only in the context of visual stimuli and are used with a reduced efficiency. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Blindness; Multisensory functions; Sensitive phases; Spatial remapping","Adult; Blindness; Female; Functional Laterality; Hand; Humans; Judgment; Male; Reaction Time; Recovery of Function; Space Perception; Touch; Vision, Ocular; Young Adult; adult; article; case report; congenital blindness; congenital cataract; controlled study; convalescence; human; male; sensitivity analysis; sensory analysis; sensory evaluation; stimulus response; tactile discrimination; tactile feedback; tactile stimulation; task performance; visual acuity; visual information; visual stimulation","Bremner A.J., Hill E.L., Pratt M., Rigato S., Spence C., Bodily illusions in young children: developmental change in visual and proprioceptive contributions to perceived hand position, PLoS One, 8, 1, (2013); Bremner A.J., Mareshal D., Lloyd-Fox S., Spence C., Spatial localization of touch in the first year of life: early influence of a visual spatial code and the development of remapping across changes in limb position, Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 137, 1, pp. 149-162, (2008); Cadieux M.L., Barnett-Cowan M., Shore D.I., Crossing the hands is more confusing for females than males, Experimental Brain Research, 204, 3, pp. 431-446, (2010); Collignon O., Charbonneau G., Lassonde M., Lepore F., Early visual deprivation alters multisensory processing in peripersonal space, Neuropsychologia, 47, 14, pp. 3236-3243, (2009); Craig J.C., The effect of hand position and pattern motion on temporal order judgments, Perception and Psychophysics, 65, 5, pp. 779-788, (2003); Crawford J.R., Garthwaite P.H., Porter S., Point and interval estimates of effect sizes for the case-controls design in neuropsychology: rationale, methods, implementations, and proposed reporting standards, Cognitive Neuropsychology, 27, 3, pp. 245-260, (2010); Heed T., Roder B., Common anatomical and external coding for hands and feet in tactile attention: Evidence from event-related potentials, Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 22, 1, pp. 184-202, (2010); Knudsen E.I., Sensitive periods in the development of the brain and behavior, Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 16, 8, pp. 1412-1425, (2004); Maurer D., Mondloch C.J., Lewis T.L., Sleeper effects, Developmental Science, 10, 1, pp. 40-47, (2007); Le Grand R., Mondloch C.J., Maurer D., Brent H.P., Impairment in holistic face processing following early visual deprivation, Psychological Science, 15, 11, pp. 762-768, (2004); Pagel B., Heed T., Roder B., Change of reference frame for tactile localization during child development, Developmental Science, 12, 6, pp. 929-937, (2009); Pouget A., Deneve S., Duhamel J.R., A computational perspective on the neural basis of multisensory spatial representations, Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 3, 9, pp. 741-747, (2002); Putzar L., Hotting K., Rosler F., Roder B., The development of visual feature binding processes after visual deprivation in early infancy, Vision Research, 47, 10, pp. 2616-2626, (2007); Roder B., Rosler F., Spence C., Early vision impairs tactile perception in the blind, Current Biology, 14, 2, pp. 121-124, (2004); Roder B., Kusmierek A., Spence C., Schicke T., Developmental vision determines the reference frame for the multisensory control of action, Proceedings of the National Academy of Science USA, 104, 11, pp. 4753-4758, (2007); Shore D.I., Spry E., Spence C., Confusing the mind by crossing the hands, Cognitive Brain Research, 14, 1, pp. 153-163, (2002); Spence C., Pavani F., Driver J., Spatial constraints on visual-tactile cross-modal distractor congruency effects, Cognitive, Affective & Behavioral Neuroscience, 4, 2, pp. 148-169, (2004); Spence C., Pavani F., Maravita A., Holmes N.P., Multi-sensory interactions, Haptic rendering: Foundations, algorithms, and application, (2008); Wada M., Suzuki M., Takaki A., Miyao M., Spence C., Kansaku K., Impaired allocentric stance in autistic children; Yamamoto S., Kitazawa S., Reversal of subjective temporal order due to arm crossing, Nature Neuroscience, 4, 7, pp. 759-765, (2001)","2-s2.0-84876428966"

In permanently congenital blind individuals both intramodal plasticity (e.g. changes in auditory cortex) as well as crossmodal plasticity (e.g. an activation of visual cortex by auditory stimuli) have been observed. Both phenomena were hypothesized to contribute to improved auditory functions. For example, it has been shown that early permanently blind individuals outperform sighted controls in auditory motion processing and that auditory motion stimuli elicit activity in typical visual motion areas. Yet it is unknown what happens to these behavioral adaptations and cortical reorganizations when sight is restored, that is, whether compensatory auditory changes are lost and to which degree visual motion processing is reinstalled. Here we employed a combined behavioral-electrophysiological approach in a group of sight-recovery individuals with a history of a transient phase of congenital blindness lasting for several months to several years. They, as well as two control groups, one with visual impairments, one normally sighted, were tested in a visual and an auditory motion discrimination experiment. Task difficulty was manipulated by varying the visual motion coherence and the signal to noise ratio, respectively. The congenital cataract-reversal individuals showed lower performance in the visual global motion task than both control groups. At the same time, they outperformed both control groups in auditory motion processing suggesting that at least some compensatory behavioral adaptation as a consequence of a complete blindness from birth was maintained. Alpha oscillatory activity during the visual task was significantly lower in congenital cataract reversal individuals and they did not show ERPs modulated by visual motion coherence as observed in both control groups. In contrast, beta oscillatory activity in the auditory task, which varied as a function of SNR in all groups, was overall enhanced in congenital cataract reversal individuals. These results suggest that intramodal plasticity elicited by a transient phase of blindness was maintained and might mediate the prevailing auditory processing advantages in congenital cataract reversal individuals. By contrast, auditory and visual motion processing do not seem to compete for the same neural resources. We speculate that incomplete visual recovery is due to impaired neural network turning which seems to depend on early visual input. The present results demonstrate a privilege of the first arriving input for shaping neural circuits mediating both auditory and visual functions. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Auditory motion processing; Beta oscillations; Congenital cataracts; Event-related potentials; Sight restoration; Visual motion processing","Adolescent; Adult; Alpha Rhythm; Auditory Perception; Beta Rhythm; Blindness; Cataract; Cataract Extraction; Cerebral Cortex; Child; Evoked Potentials; Female; Humans; Male; Motion Perception; Vision Disorders; Young Adult; adaptation; adolescent; adult; alpha rhythm; Article; auditory cortex; auditory discrimination; auditory stimulation; beta rhythm; brain function; child; childbirth; clinical article; congenital blindness; congenital cataract; controlled study; female; human; male; mental task; movement perception; nerve cell network; nerve cell plasticity; neurophysiology; preschool child; priority journal; school child; sensory system electrophysiology; signal noise ratio; task performance; visual cortex; visual impairment; visuomotor coordination; blindness; brain cortex; cataract; cataract extraction; evoked response; hearing; movement perception; pathophysiology; physiology; visual disorder; young adult","Bavelier D., Neville H.J., Cross-modal plasticity: where and how?, Nat.

However, it is still unclear whether the representation of coherent auditory and visual events requires any prior audiovisual experience to develop and function. Here we measured brain synchronization during the presentation of an audiovisual, audio-only or video-only version of the same narrative in distinct groups of sensory-deprived (congenitally blind and deaf) and typically developed individuals. Intersubject correlation analysis revealed that the superior temporal cortex was synchronized across auditory and visual conditions, even in sensory-deprived individuals who lack any audiovisual experience. This synchronization was primarily mediated by low-level perceptual features, and relied on a similar modality-independent topographical organization of slow temporal dynamics. The human superior temporal cortex is naturally endowed with a functional scaffolding to yield a common representation across multisensory events. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Acoustic Stimulation; Auditory Perception; Brain; Humans; Temporal Lobe; Visual Perception; auditory stimulation; brain; hearing; human; temporal lobe; vision","Stein B.E., Stanford T.R., Multisensory integration: current issues from the perspective of the single neuron, Nat.

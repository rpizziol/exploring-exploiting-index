10.1051/0004-6361/202245247,0,"In the nearby universe, jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN) are observed to have a dramatic impact on their surrounding extragalactic environment. The effect of jets at high redshift (z > 1.5) is instead much more poorly constrained. However, studying the jet impact at cosmic noon, the epoch in which both star formation and AGN activity peak, is crucial for fully understanding galaxy evolution. Here we present a study of the giant (~750 kpc) radio galaxy 103025+052430 located at the centre of a protocluster at redshift z = 1.7, with a focus on its interaction with the external medium. We present new LOFAR observations at 144 MHz, which we combine with VLA 1.4 GHz data and 0.5-7 keV Chandra archival data. The new radio map at 144 MHz confirms that the source has a complex morphology, which can possibly fit the hybrid morphology radio galaxy classification. The large size of the source enabled us to perform a resolved radio spectral index analysis, a very unique opportunity for a source at this high redshift. This revealed a tentative unexpected flattening of the radio spectral index at the edge of the backflow in the western lobe, which might be indicating plasma compression. The spatial coincidence between this region and the thermal X-ray bubble C suggests a causal connection between the two. In contrast to previous estimates for the bright X-ray component A, we find that inverse Compton scattering between the radio-emitting plasma of the eastern lobe and cosmic microwave background photons can account for a large fraction (~45%-80%) of its total 0.5-7 keV measured flux. Finally, the X-ray bubble C, which is consistent with a thermal origin, is found to be significantly overpressurised with respect to the ambient medium. This suggests that it will tend to expand and release its energy into the surroundings, contributing to the overall intracluster medium heating. Overall, 103025+052430 enables us to investigate the interaction between AGN jets and the surrounding medium in a system that is likely the predecessor of the rich galaxy clusters we all know well at z = 0.","Brienza, M.;Gilli, R.;Prandoni, I.;D'Amato, Q.;Rajpurohit, K.;Calura, F.;Chiaberge, M.;Comastri, A.;Iwasawa, K.;Lanzuisi, G.;Liuzzo, E.;Marchesi, S.;Mignoli, M.;Miley, G.;Norman, C.;Peca, A.;Raciti, M.;Shimwell, T.;Tozzi, P.;Vignali, C.;Vitello, F.;Vito, F.",56728467500;56253699200;55887427800;57202290561;56197249000;6602801290;7003345053;7004410116;7006136358;26639452800;26435406400;55928727000;8277154200;7103352325;35458856700;57212080815;57218265988;25923982800;7006405769;7006844392;35173983800;55383571900
10.1109/EuroSPW59978.2023.00005,0,"Modern cars are getting so computerised that ENISA's phrase 'smart cars' is a perfect fit. The amount of personal data that they process is very large and, yet, increasing. Hence, the need to address citizens' privacy while they drive and, correspondingly, the importance of privacy threat modelling (in support of a respective risk assessment, such as through a Data Protection Impact Assessment). This paper addresses privacy threats by advancing a general modelling methodology and by demonstrating it specifically on soft privacy, which ensures citizens' full control on their personal data. By considering all relevant threat agents, the paper applies the methodology to the specific automotive domain while keeping threats at the same level of detail as ENISA's. The main result beside the modelling methodology consists of both domain-independent and automotive domain-dependent soft privacy threats. While cybersecurity has been vastly threat-modelled so far, this paper extends the literature with a threat model for soft privacy on smart cars, producing 17 domain-independent threats that, associated with 41 domain-specific assets, shape a novel set of domain-dependent threats in automotive.","Raciti, Mario;Bella, Giampaolo",57218265988;7102585535
10.5220/0011998800003479,1,"This paper questions how to approach threat modelling in the automotive domain at both an abstract level that features no domain-specific entities such as the CAN bus and, separately, at a detailed level. It addresses such questions by contributing a systematic method that is currently affected by the analyst’s subjectivity because most of its inner operations are only defined informally. However, this potential limitation is overcome when candidate threats are identified and left to everyone’s scrutiny. The systematic method is demonstrated on the established LINDDUN threat modelling methodology with respect to 4 pivotal works on privacy threat modelling in automotive. As a result, 8 threats that the authors deem not representable in LINDDUN are identified and suggested as possible candidate extensions to LINDDUN. Also, 56 threats are identified providing a detailed, automotive-specific model of threats.","Raciti, Mario;Bella, Giampaolo",57218265988;7102585535
10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3245333,0,"This article recognises the widespread application of risk assessment in ICT and aims at reducing the influence of human subjectivity and distraction by means of a methodology for the Automated and Intelligent Likelihood Assignment (AILA). The AILA Methodology, with its various components, applies when risk assessment proceeds exclusively upon information stated in a policy coming as a text document. This scenario is extremely common through small to medium sized institutions. Among the main contributions of this article lies the AILA Entity Extractor, which facilitates the risk assessor in the identification of entities, then of assets, from a given policy. Then, the AILA Classifier automates the assignment of likelihood values to given threats for assets. Moreover, the synergy of AILA with an existing tool for risk assessment demonstrates how to achieve more objective likelihood assignments. AILA is general in support of any risk assessment and, for the sake of demonstration, is applied to assess the privacy risk induced over physical persons by three real-world manufacturers from the automotive domain, namely Toyota, Mercedes and Tesla. AILA is also validated against a risk assessment methodology by ENISA, thereby confirming effectiveness and efficiency of the new methodology (which is dramatically more automated than ENISA's). AILA combines and consolidates together several techniques in an unprecedented fashion, including Natural Language Processing by summarisation and entity recognition, dataset labelling by appeal to the ToS;DR service, and fully-supervised Machine Learning and regression analysis. Finally, to contribute to open knowledge, the general, executable components of AILA, the AILA Entity Extractor and the AILA Classifier are released open source along with the privacy-specific components, the AILA Privacy Dataset and the AILA Privacy Model.","Bella, Giampaolo;Daniele, Cristian;Raciti, Mario",7102585535;57878416600;57218265988
10.1016/j.ascom.2022.100660,1,"The Gaia Astrometric Verification Unit–Global Sphere Reconstruction (AVU–GSR) Parallel Solver aims to find the astrometric parameters for ∼108 stars in the Milky Way, the attitude and the instrumental specifications of the Gaia satellite, and the global parameter γ of the post Newtonian formalism. The code iteratively solves a system of linear equations, A×x=b, where the coefficient matrix A is large (∼1011×108 elements) and sparse. To solve this system of equations, the code exploits a hybrid implementation of the iterative PC-LSQR algorithm, where the computation related to different horizontal portions of the coefficient matrix is assigned to separate MPI processes. In the original code, each matrix portion is further parallelized over the OpenMP threads. To further improve the code performance, we ported the application to the GPU, replacing the OpenMP parallelization language with OpenACC. In this port, ∼95% of the data is copied from the host to the device at the beginning of the entire cycle of iterations, making the code compute bound rather than data-transfer bound. The OpenACC code presents a speedup of ∼1.5 over the OpenMP version but further optimizations are in progress to obtain higher gains. The code runs on multiple GPUs and it was tested on the CINECA supercomputer Marconi100, in anticipation of a port to the pre-exascale system Leonardo, that will be installed at CINECA in 2022.","Cesare, V.;Becciani, U.;Vecchiato, A.;Lattanzi, M.

,2,"We present the current development of the Monitoring, Logging and Alarm subsystems in the framework of the Array Control and Data Acquisition System (ACADA) for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). The Monitoring System (MON) is the subsystem responsible for monitoring and logging the overall array (at each of the CTA sites) through the acquisition of monitoring and logging information from the array elements. The MON allows us to perform a systematic approach to fault detection and diagnosis supporting corrective and predictive maintenance to minimize the downtime of the system. We present a unified tool for monitoring data items from the telescopes and other devices deployed at the CTA array sites. Data are immediately available for the operator interface and quick-look quality checks and stored for later detailed inspection. The Array Alarm System (AAS) is the subsystem that provides the service that gathers, filters, exposes, and persists alarms raised by both the ACADA processes and the array elements supervised by the ACADA system. It collects alarms from the telescopes, the array calibration, the environmental monitoring instruments and the ACADA systems. The AAS sub-system also creates new alarms based on the analysis and correlation of the system software logs and the status of the system hardware providing the filter mechanisms for all the alarms. Data from the alarm system are then sent to the operator via the human-machine interface.","Costa, Alessandro;Munari, Kevin;Incardona, Federico;Bruno, Pietro;Germani, Stefano;Grillo, Alessandro;Oya, Igor;Sciacca, Eva;Becciani, Ugo;Raciti, Mario",22834392900;57274669900;57202603340;7102148174;22979302300;56271982200;57201641416;23029041000;57521968800;57218265988

10.1109/CSP55486.2022.00030,1,"Risk assessment is core to any institution's evaluation of risk, notably for what concerns people's privacy. The assessment often relies on information stated in a policy shaped as a text document. The risk assessor, or analyst in brief, is called to understand documentation that can be long, unclear or incomplete, hence subjectivity or distraction may strongly influence the process, particularly for identifying each relevant asset and for the assignment of the likelihood value of a given threat to an identified asset. The aim of this paper is to reduce the influence of subjectivity and distraction through risk assessment by means of our methodology for the Automated and Intelligent Likelihood Assignment (AILA). While the analyst's role cannot be emptied, it is facilitated through entities identification and likelihood assignment to threats for assets. The methodology adopts Natural Language Processing for summarisation and entity recognition, it tailors fully-supervised Machine Learning over policy documents and it leverages an existing tool supporting risk assessment, PILAR, in order to gain a more objective likelihood assignment. The paper demonstrates AILA over three real-world case studies from the automotive domain, culminating with the risk assessment exercises over the privacy policies of Toyota, Mercedes and Tesla. The executable components of AILA, the AILA Entity Extractor and the AILA Classifier are released as open source.","Bella, Giampaolo;Daniele, Cristian;Raciti, Mario",7102585535;57878416600;57218265988

10.1145/3539618.3591926,0,"A wide range of core information retrieval (IR) tasks, such as searching, ranking, and filtering, to name a few, have seen tremendous improvements thanks to machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). The traditional centralized approach to training AI/ML models is still predominant: large volumes of data generated by end users must be transferred from their origins and shared with remote locations for processing. However, this centralized paradigm suffers from significant privacy issues and does not take full advantage of the computing power of client devices like modern smartphones. A possible answer to this need is provided by federated learning (FL), which enables collaborative training of predictive models among a set of cooperating edge devices without disclosing any private local data. Unfortunately, FL is still far from being fully exploited in the IR ecosystem. In this workshop proposal, we have the ambition to start filling this gap. More specifically, the first workshop on “Federated Learning for Information ReTrieval” (FLIRT) is willing to provide an open forum for researchers and practitioners where they can exchange ideas, identify key challenges, and define the roadmap toward a successful application of FL in the broad IR area.","Pinelli, Fabio;Tolomei, Gabriele;Trappolini, Giovanni",57223750427;12784026600;57219766943

Such data can be enriched with several semantic dimensions (or aspects), i.e., contextual and heterogeneous information captured in the surrounding environment, leading to the creation of multiple aspect trajectories (MATs). In this work, we present how the MAT-Builder system can be used for the semantic enrichment processing of movement data while being agnostic to aspects and external semantic data sources. This is achieved by integrating MAT-Builder into a methodology which encompasses three design principles and a uniform representation formalism for enriched data based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF) format. An example scenario involving the generation and querying of a dataset of MATs gives a glimpse of the possibilities that our methodology can open up.","Lettich, Francesco;Pugliese, Chiara;Renso, Chiara;Pinelli, Fabio",56131768500;57879304000;6602915124;57223750427
10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3307824,0,"The widespread adoption of personal location devices, the Internet of Mobile Things, and Location Based Social Networks, enables the collection of vast amounts of movement data. This data often needs to be enriched with a variety of semantic dimensions, or aspects, that provide contextual and heterogeneous information about the surrounding environment, resulting in the creation of multiple aspect trajectories (MATs). Common examples of aspects can be points of interest, user photos, transportation means, weather conditions, social media posts, and many more. However, the literature does not currently provide a consensus on how to semantically enrich mobility data with aspects, particularly in dynamic scenarios where semantic information is extracted from numerous and heterogeneous external data sources. In this work, we aim to address this issue by presenting a comprehensive methodology to facilitate end users in instantiating their semantic enrichment processes of movement data. The methodology is agnostic to semantic aspects and external semantic data sources. The vision behind our methodology rests on three pillars: (1) three design principles which we argue are necessary for designing systems capable of instantiating arbitrary semantic enrichment processes; (2) the MAT-Builder system, which embodies these principles; (3) the use of an RDF knowledge graph-based representation to store MATs datasets, thereby enabling uniform querying and analysis of enriched movement data. We qualitatively evaluate the methodology in two complementary example scenarios, where we show both the potential in generating interesting and useful semantically enriched mobility datasets, and the expressive power in querying the resulting RDF trajectories with SPARQL.","Lettich, Francesco;Pugliese, Chiara;Renso, Chiara;Pinelli, Fabio",56131768500;57879304000;6602915124;57223750427

10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3229124,1,"Federated learning (FL) goes beyond traditional, centralized machine learning by distributing model training among a large collection of edge clients. These clients cooperatively train a global, e.g., cloud-hosted, model without disclosing their local, private training data. The global model is then shared among all the participants which use it for local predictions. This paper proves that FL systems can be turned into covert channels to implement a stealth communication infrastructure. The main intuition is that, during federated training, a malicious sender can poison the global model by submitting purposely crafted examples. Although the effect of the model poisoning is negligible to other participants and does not alter the overall model performance, it can be observed by a malicious receiver and used to transmit a sequence of bits. We mounted our attack on an FL system to verify its feasibility. Experimental evidence shows that this covert channel is reliable, efficient, and extremely hard to counter. These results highlight that our new attacker model threatens FL infrastructures.","Costa, Gabriele;Pinelli, Fabio;Soderi, Simone;Tolomei, Gabriele",32067717500;57223750427;56027760800;12784026600
,0,"The notion of multiple aspect trajectory (MAT) has been recently introduced in the literature to represent movement data that is heavily semantically enriched with dimensions (aspects) representing various types of semantic information (e.g., stops, moves, weather, traffic, events, and points of interest). Aspects may be large in number, heterogeneous, or structurally complex. Although there is a growing volume of literature addressing the modelling and analysis of multiple aspect trajectories, the community suffers from a general lack of publicly available datasets. This is due to privacy concerns that make it difficult to publish such type of data, and to the lack of tools that are capable of linking raw spatio-temporal data to different types of semantic contextual data.

10.1109/TITS.2015.2496783,45,"This paper presents a data-driven method for transit network design that relies on a large sample of user location data available from mobile phone telecommunication networks. Such data provide opportunistic sensing and the means for transit operators to match supply with mobility demand inferred from mobile phone locations. In contrast to previous methods of transit network design, the proposed method is entirely data driven, leveraging the large-sample properties of disaggregate mobile phone network data and mobility pattern mining. The method works by deriving frequent patterns of movements from anonymized mobile phone location data and merging them to generate candidate route designs. Additional routines for optimal route selection and service frequency setting are then employed to select a network configuration made up of routes that maximizes systemwide traveler utility. Using data from half a million mobile phone users in Abidjan from the telco operator Orange, we demonstrated to provide resource-neutral system improvement of 27% in terms of end-user journey times.","Pinelli, Fabio;Nair, Rahul;Calabrese, Francesco;Berlingerio, Michele;Di Lorenzo, Giusy;Sbodio, Marco Luca",57223750427;55421037900;17433489200;15622798800;35810068100;55886127400

With large scale data on mobility patterns, operators can move away from the costly, mostly survey based, transportation planning processes, to a more data-centric view, that places the instrumented user at the center of development. In this framework, using mobile phone data to perform transit analysis and optimization represents a new frontier with significant societal impact, especially in developing countries. In this paper we present AllAboard, an intelligent tool that analyses cellphone data to help city authorities in visually exploring urban mobility and optimizing public transport. This is performed within a self contained tool, as opposed to the current solutions which rely on a combination of several distinct tools for analysis, reporting, optimisation and planning. An interactive user interface allows transit operators to visually explore the travel demand in both space and time, correlate it with the transit network, and evaluate the quality of service that a transit network provides to the citizens at very fine grain. Operators can visually test scenarios for transit network improvements, and compare the expected impact on the travellers' experience.

10.1109/BigData.2015.7363860,28,"Telecommunications operators (telcos) traditional sources of income, voice and SMS, are shrinking due to customers using over-the-top (OTT) applications such as WhatsApp or Viber. In this challenging environment it is critical for telcos to maintain or grow their market share, by providing users with as good an experience as possible on their network. But the task of extracting customer insights from the vast amounts of data collected by telcos is growing in complexity and scale everey day. How can we measure and predict the quality of a user's experience on a telco network in real-time? That is the problem that we address in this paper. We present an approach to capture, in (near) real-time, the mobile customer experience in order to assess which conditions lead the user to place a call to a telco's customer care center. To this end, we follow a supervised learning approach for prediction and train our Restricted Random Forest model using, as a proxy for bad experience, the observed customer transactions in the telco data feed before the user places a call to a customer care center. We evaluate our approach using a rich dataset provided by a major African telecommunication's company and a novel big data architecture for both the training and scoring of predictive models. Our empirical study shows our solution to be effective at predicting user experience by inferring if a customer will place a call based on his current context. These promising results open new possibilities for improved customer service, which will help telcos to reduce churn rates and improve customer experience, both factors that directly impact their revenue growth.","Diaz-Aviles, Ernesto;Pinelli, Fabio;Lynch, Karol;Nabi, Zubair;Gkoufas, Yiannis;Bouillet, Eric;Calabrese, Francesco;Coughlan, Eoin;Holland, Peter;Salzwedel, Jason",35179319700;57223750427;8665514100;36634698300;56109440200;6701327482;17433489200;57223954327;57188843994;57188837191

Thus, several applications to infer urban dynamics where proposed. However, different papers have used different types of mobile phone location data, making it is difficult to understand whether a particular dataset provided by a telecom operator is indeed effective for a specific urban sensing application. In this paper we address this issue by comparing the quality of the insights extracted from different types of mobile phone location data, with specific reference to two urban sensing applications: people count by location, and people flow between locations. Experiments executed on a real dataset provided by a telecom operator in Belgium show the advantages of using network-driven mobile phone location data (collected regardless on whether people are using their phone) compared to the widely used Call Detail Records.","Pinelli, Fabio;Lorenzo, Giusy Di;Calabrese, Francesco",57223750427;35810068100;17433489200

Cities can leverage such knowledge to provide better services (e.g., public transport planning, optimized resource allocation) and safer environment. Call Detail Record (CDR) data represents a practical data source to detect and monitor unusual events considering the high level of mobile phone penetration, compared with GPS equipped and open devices. In this paper, we propose a methodology that is able to detect unusual events from CDR data, which typically has low accuracy in terms of space and time resolution. Moreover, we introduce a concept of unusual event that involves a large amount of people who expose an unusual mobility behavior. Our careful consideration of the issues that come from coarse-grained CDR data ultimately leads to a completely general framework that can detect unusual crowd events from CDR data effectively and efficiently. Through extensive experiments on real-world CDR data for a large city in Africa, we demonstrate that our method can detect unusual events with 16% higher recall and over 10× higher precision, compared to state-of-the-art methods. We implement a visual analytics prototype system to help end users analyze detected unusual crowd events to best suit different application scenarios.

However, privacy is at risk if it is possible to reconstruct the identity of individuals from sequential data. Therefore, it is important to develop privacy-preserving techniques that support publishing of really anonymous data, without altering the analysis results significantly. In this paper we propose to apply the Privacy-by-design paradigm for designing a technological framework to counter the threats of undesirable, unlawful effects of privacy violation on sequence data, without obstructing the knowledge discovery opportunities of data mining technologies. First, we introduce a k-anonymity framework for sequence data, by defining the sequence linking attack model and its associated countermeasure, a k-anonymity notion for sequence datasets, which provides a formal protection against the attack. Second, we instantiate this framework and provide a specific method for constructing the k-anonymous version of a sequence dataset, which preserves the results of sequential pattern mining, together with several basic statistics and other analytical properties of the original data, including the clustering structure.

Probabilistic information on transfers is gathered from a prototypical journey planner, a public-facing tool that transit riders query to find optimal paths through a multimodal network. Aggregating journey plans in this manner provides information on optimal transfers as perceived by the service operator, which are then targeted for improvements. The model is implemented on the large-scale transit network of Washington, D.C., where sampled journey plans representing 9% of the daily transit demand are used to generate a modified schedule that leads to a reduction in passenger wait times by 26.38%.

In this paper, we present a class of algorithms which use Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) for demand and availability prediction on various time scales. In contrast to existing methods, exogenous effects can be explicitly factored into the models, resulting in significant gains in terms of prediction accuracy. Another advantage of our approach is that it estimates the distribution of the waiting time for the next available bike/parking lot if the current availability is zero.

So far, the problem has been widely studied in monodimensional networks, i.e. networks where only one connection between two entities may exist. However, real networks are often multidimensional, i.e., multiple connections between any two nodes may exist, either reflecting different kinds of relationships, or representing different values of the same type of tie. In this context, the problem of community discovery has to be redefined, taking into account multidimensional structure of the graph. We define a new concept of community that groups together nodes sharing memberships to the same monodimensional communities in the different single dimensions. As we show, such communities are meaningful and able to group nodes even if they might not be connected in any of the monodimensional networks. We devise frequent pAttern mining-BAsed Community discoverer in mUltidimensional networkS (ABACUS), an algorithm that is able to extract multidimensional communities based on the extraction of frequent closed itemsets from monodimensional community memberships.

M-Atlas is centered onto the concept of a trajectory, and the mobility knowledge discovery process can be specified by M-Atlas queries that realize data transformations, data-driven estimation of the parameters of the mining methods, the quality assessment of the obtained results, the quantitative and visual exploration of the discovered behavioral patterns and models, the composition of mined patterns, models and data with further analyses and mining, and the incremental mining strategies to address scalability. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Giannotti, Fosca;Nanni, Mirco;Pedreschi, Dino;Pinelli, Fabio;Renso, Chiara;Rinzivillo, Salvatore;Trasarti, Roberto",7004495132;7006849378;6603935985;57223750427;6602915124;12760259500;23987033600

It is possible to analyze such huge collection of data to look for critical situation on the traffic flow. The offline analysis of traffic congestions represents a challenging task for urban mobility managers. This kind of analysis can be used by the traffic planner to predict future areas of traffic congestions, or to improve the accessibility to specific attraction points in a city.Many traffic systems adopt ad-hoc sensors like cameras, induction loops, magnetic sensors to monitor the status of the traffic flows: these systems are very expensive for installation and maintenance, and they are restricted to the local monitoring of the road arcs where they are installed. On the contrary, the use of GPS data to check the traffic conditions requires low installation costs (a part for the installation on the vehicle) and it enables to virtually monitoring the entire road network. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Ong, Rebecca;Pinelli, Fabio;Trasarti, Roberto;Nanni, Mirco;Renso, Chiara;Rinzivillo, Salvatore;Giannotti, Fosca",36987086400;57223750427;23987033600;7006849378;6602915124;12760259500;7004495132

We instantiate the profile matching problem to a specific application context, namely proactive car pooling services, and therefore develop a matching criterion that satisfies various basic constraints obtained from the background knowledge of the application domain. In order to evaluate the impact and robustness of the methods introduced, two experiments are reported, which were performed on a massive dataset containing GPS traces of private cars: (i) the impact of the car pooling application based on profile matching is measured, in terms of percentage shareable traffic; (ii) the approach is adapted to coarser-grained mobility data sources that are nowadays commonly available from telecom operators. In addition the ensuing loss in precision and coverage of profile matches is measured.

Nowadays, thanks to the availability of tracking devices on public transportation devices, it is possible to evaluate such accessibility very accurately, and derive useful performance measures. In this paper, we propose a complete methodological process to analysize and measure the accessibility of a city using bus GPS traces. Firstly, the process involves the application of recent results in spatio-temporal data mining in order to detect bus lines and bus stops from the traces dataset. Then an agent-based algorithm is used to simulate human mobility in the network, in order to study how the accessibility of the city changes over time, and starting from different locations in the city. Finally, the methodology is applied to bus traces collected for the city of Rome and both the detection process and the accessibility study are deeply investigate. © 2009 IEEE.","Pinelli, Fabio;Hou, Anyang;Calabrese, Francesco;Nanni, Mirco;Zegras, Chris;Ratti, Carlo",57223750427;35229665900;17433489200;7006849378;6602394964;35230766400

However, privacy is at risk if it is possible to reconstruct the identity of individuals from sequential data. Therefore, it is important to develop privacy-preserving techniques that support publishing of really anonymous data, without altering the analysis results significantly. First, we introduce a k-anonymity framework for sequence data, by defining the sequence linking attack model and its associated countermeasure, a k-anonymity notion for sequence datasets, which provides a formal protection against the attack. Second, we instantiate this framework and provide a specific method for constructing the k-anonymous version of a sequence dataset, which preserves the results of sequential pattern mining.

The car can receive and store waypoint information, find the shortest route to these waypoints, integrate traffic information, find points-of-interest, and alert the driver of a pre-programmed set of maintenance issues related to the car. Here, we propose a new route system that is multi-goal-centric rather than waypoint-centric. Instead of focusing on determining the route to a specified waypoint, as done in commercially available navigation systems, the system will analyze the driver's behavior in order to extract the potential set(s) of goals that the driver would like to achieve. The system must also understand the city on a number of levels: physical, social, and commercial. This provides the foundation for a social and intelligent driving assistant, that helps the driver achieve his goals and helps the city perform better through interaction between both entities. © 2009 IEEE.","Di Lorenzo, Giusy;Pinelli, Fabio;Pereira, Francisco C.;Biderman, Assaf;Ratti, Carlo;Lee, Charles;Lee, Chuhee",35810068100;57223750427;57212525667;56062949800;35230766400;56101060900;55763062600

10.1145/1557019.1557038,8,"In the past few years there has been an increasing interest in the analysis of process logs. Several proposed techniques, such as workflow mining, are aimed at automatically deriving the underlying workflow models. However, current approaches only pay little attention on an important piece of information contained in process logs: the timestamps, which are used to define a sequential ordering of the performed tasks. In this work we try to overcome these limitations by explicitly including time in the extracted knowledge, thus making the temporal information a first-class citizen of the analysis process. This makes it possible to discern between apparently identical process executions that are performed with different transition times between consecutive tasks. This paper proposes a framework for the user-interactive exploration of a condensed representation of groups of executions of a given process. The framework is based on the use of an existing mining paradigm: Temporally-Annotated Sequences (TAS). These are aimed at extracting sequential patterns where each transition between two events is annotated with a typical transition time that emerges from input data. With the extracted TAS, which represent sets of possible frequent executions with their typical transition times, a few factorizing operators are built. These operators condense such executions according to possible parallel or possible mutual exclusive executions. Lastly, such condensed representation is rendered to the user via the exploration graph, namely the Temporally-Annotated Graph (TAG). The user, the domain expert, is allowed to explore the different and alternative factorizations corresponding to different interpretations of the actual executions. According to the user choices, the system discards or retains certain hypotheses on actual executions and shows the consequent scenarios resulting from the coresponding re-aggregation of the actual data.

We report a real-world case study, in which the TAS mining paradigm is applied to databases of log traces obtained from the actual execution of processes.

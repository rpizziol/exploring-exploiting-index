In this article, we propose a framework based on model predictive control (MPC) that endows the self-driving vehicle with the necessary safety guarantees. In particular, our framework ensures constraint satisfaction at all times while tracking the reference trajectory as close as obstacles allow, resulting in a safe and comfortable driving behavior. To discuss the performance and real-time capability of our framework, we provide first an illustrative simulation example, and then, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in experiments with a real test vehicle.","Batkovic, Ivo;Gupta, Ankit;Zanon, Mario;Falcone, Paolo",57205377245;57202697764;55375650900;16177384900
10.1109/TAC.2022.3207875,1,"In the model predictive control formulations of trajectory tracking problems, infeasible reference trajectories and a priori unknown constraints can lead to cumbersome designs, aggressive tracking, and loss of recursive feasibility. This is the case, for example, in trajectory tracking applications for mobile systems in the presence of constraints that are not fully known a priori. In this article, we propose a new framework called model predictive flexible trajectory tracking control, which relaxes the trajectory tracking requirement. In addition, we accommodate recursive feasibility in the presence of a priori unknown constraints, which might render the reference trajectory infeasible. In the proposed framework, constraint satisfaction is guaranteed at all times while the reference trajectory is tracked as good as constraint satisfaction allows, thus simplifying the controller design and reducing possibly aggressive tracking behavior. The proposed framework is illustrated with three numerical examples.","Batkovic, Ivo;Ali, Mohammad;Falcone, Paolo;Zanon, Mario",57205377245;57693425100;16177384900;55375650900
10.1109/TAC.2022.3187853,0,"Linear models with additive unknown-but-bounded input disturbances are extensively used to model uncertainty in robust control system design. Typically, the disturbance set is either assumed to be known a priori or estimated from data through set-membership identification. However, the problem of computing a suitable input disturbance set in case the set of possible output values is assigned a priori has received relatively little attention. This problem arises in many contexts, such as in supervisory control, actuator design, decentralized control, and others. In this article, we propose a method to compute input disturbance sets (and the corresponding set of states) such that the resulting set of outputs matches as closely as possible a given set of outputs, while additionally satisfying strict (inner or outer) inclusion constraints. We formulate the problem as an optimization problem by relying on the concept of robust invariance. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated in numerical examples that illustrate how to solve safe reference set and input constraint set computation problems.","Mulagaleti, Sampath Kumar;Bemporad, Alberto;Zanon, Mario",57205378375;7005030586;55375650900

We tackle the optimization problem using an implicit RPI set approach that provides a priori approximation error guarantees, and adopt a novel disturbance set parameterization that permits the encoding of the set of feasible disturbance sets as a polyhedron.

While it is well-known how to design a closed-loop stable MPC with respect to a reference trajectory that satisfies the system dynamics, this chapter discusses how to guarantee stability of a vehicle motion planner and controller when a user-provided arbitrary reference is used. Furthermore, the proposed MPC scheme enables recursive collision-avoidance constraint satisfaction in the presence of pop-up or moving obstacles (e.g., pedestrians, cyclists, human-driven vehicles), provided that their predicted future motion trajectory is available together with some uncertainty bound and satisfies some mild requirement.

10.1109/LCSYS.2023.3284763,0,"Economic MPC (EMPC) optimizes closed-loop performance by directly minimizing a given objective function, as opposed to Tracking MPC (TMPC) which instead penalizes deviations from a precalculated optimal reference. The main difference between the two approaches can be observed during transients, as the former always acts optimally, while the latter is only optimal when the reference is accurately tracked. Unfortunately, stability for EMPC is in general difficult to prove, as opposed to TMPC which builds on a rich theory. Additionally, many efficient algorithms are available for TMPC, while solving the EMPC problem can be much harder. In prior works, a family of discrete-time TMPC schemes that provide approximate economic optimality has been developed in order to partially overcome these issues In this letter, we aim at extending such a family of TMPC schemes to the continuous time case. Similarly to the discrete-time case, also in continuous-time we obtain a first-order approximation of the EMPC control law. We demonstrate the theory with a numerical example that confirms the first-order approximation and we show that our continuous-time formulation can be made equivalent to the discrete-time one.","Facchino, Matteo;Bemporad, Alberto;Zanon, Mario",57223622764;7005030586;55375650900

This can be achieved by selecting a proper stage cost and terminal cost for the OCP. A very useful particular case of OCP is a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme where a deterministic (possibly nonlinear) model is used to reduce the computational complexity. This observation leads us to parameterize an MPC scheme fully, including the cost function. In practice, Reinforcement Learning algorithms can then be used to tune the parameterized MPC scheme.

10.1016/j.automatica.2022.110598,5,"The combination of learning methods with Model Predictive Control (MPC) has attracted a significant amount of attention in the recent literature. The hope of this combination is to reduce the reliance of MPC schemes on accurate models, and to tap into the fast developing machine learning and reinforcement learning tools to exploit the growing amount of data available for many systems. In particular, the combination of reinforcement learning and MPC has been proposed as a viable and theoretically justified approach to introduce explainable, safe and stable policies in reinforcement learning. However, a formal theory detailing how the safety and stability of an MPC-based policy can be maintained through the parameter updates delivered by the learning tools is still lacking. This paper addresses this gap. The theory is developed for the generic robust MPC case, and applied in simulation in the robust tube-based linear MPC case, where the theory is fairly easy to deploy in practice. The paper focuses on reinforcement learning as a learning tool, but it applies to any learning method that updates the MPC parameters online.","Gros, Sebastien;Zanon, Mario",55694310100;55375650900

In its current form, the dissipativity theory for economic MPC applies to problems based on deterministic dynamics or to very specific classes of stochastic problems, and does not readily extend to generic Markov decision processes. In this paper, we clarify the core reason for this difficulty, and propose a generalization of the economic MPC dissipativity theory that circumvents it. This generalization focuses on undiscounted infinite-horizon problems and is based on nonlinear stage cost functionals, allowing one to discuss the Lyapunov asymptotic stability of policies for Markov decision processes in terms of the probability measures underlying their stochastic dynamics. This theory is illustrated for the stochastic linear quadratic regulator with Gaussian process noise, for which a storage functional can be provided explicitly. For the sake of brevity, we limit our discussion to undiscounted Markov decision processes.","Gros, Sebastien;Zanon, Mario",55694310100;55375650900

However, if the input set is too small, any controller will fail in stabilizing the closed-loop system while satisfying all prescribed constraints for some initial states of interest, or vice versa the chosen actuators may be oversized. To handle this issue, in this article, we address the problem of computing the smallest input constraint set such that the closed-loop system is stabilizable from a prescribed set of initial states while respecting all constraints. We focus our attention on linear systems with additive disturbances, and develop the algorithm based on recursive feasibility of robust model predictive control.

When a baseline linear controller exists that is already well tuned in the absence of constraints and MPC is introduced to enforce them, one would like to avoid altering the original linear feedback law whenever they are not active.

(2015), which we extend to a more general framework. We prove that a positive-definite stage-cost matrix yielding this matching property can be computed for all stabilizing linear controllers. In addition, we prove that the constrained estimation problem can also be solved similarly, by matching a linear observer with a moving horizon estimator.

In practice MDPs are solved based on some form of policy approximation. We will leverage recent results proposing to use Model Predictive Control (MPC) as a structured approximator in the context of Reinforcement Learning, which makes it possible to introduce stability requirements directly inside the MPC-based policy. This will restrict the solution of the MDP to stabilizing policies by construction. Because the stability theory for MPC is most mature for the undiscounted MPC case, we will first show in this paper that stable discounted MDPs can be reformulated as undiscounted ones. This observation will entail that the undiscounted MPC-based policy with stability guarantees will produce the optimal policy for the discounted MDP if it is stable, and the best stabilizing policy otherwise.","Zanon, Mario;Gros, Sébastien;Palladino, Michele",55375650900;55694310100;56203993200

Current vaccine allocation strategies are based on criteria such as age or risk. In the light of strong spatial heterogeneities in disease history and transmission, we explore spatial allocation strategies as a complement to existing approaches. Given the practical constraints and complex epidemiological dynamics, designing effective vaccination strategies at a country scale is an intricate task. We propose a novel optimal control framework to derive the best possible vaccine allocation for given disease transmission projections and constraints on vaccine supply and distribution logistics. As a proof-of-concept, we couple our framework with an existing spatially explicit compartmental COVID-19 model tailored to the Italian geographic and epidemiological context. We optimize the vaccine allocation on scenarios of unfolding disease transmission across the 107 provinces of Italy, from January to April 2021. For each scenario, the optimal solution significantly outperforms alternative strategies that prioritize provinces based on incidence, population distribution, or prevalence of susceptibles. Our results suggest that the complex interplay between the mobility network and the spatial heterogeneities implies highly non-trivial prioritization strategies for effective vaccination campaigns.

Rooted into statistical physics, the ERGMs framework has been successfully employed for reconstructing networks, detecting statistically significant patterns in graphs, counting networked configurations with given properties. From a technical point of view, the ERGMs workflow is defined by two subsequent optimization steps: the first one concerns the maximization of Shannon entropy and leads to identify the functional form of the ensemble probability distribution that is maximally non-committal with respect to the missing information; the second one concerns the maximization of the likelihood function induced by this probability distribution and leads to its numerical determination. This second step translates into the resolution of a system of O(N) non-linear, coupled equations (with N being the total number of nodes of the network under analysis), a problem that is affected by three main issues, i.e. accuracy, speed and scalability. The present paper aims at addressing these problems by comparing the performance of three algorithms (i.e. Newton’s method, a quasi-Newton method and a recently-proposed fixed-point recipe) in solving several ERGMs, defined by binary and weighted constraints in both a directed and an undirected fashion.

We introduce a mobility-based criterion to define an NMPC cost that enhances the locomotion of quadruped robots while maximizing leg mobility and improves adaptation to the terrain features. Our NMPC is based on the real-Time iteration scheme that allows us to re-plan online at 25 Hz with a prediction horizon of 2 seconds. We use the single rigid body dynamic model defined in the center of mass frame in order to increase the computational efficiency. In simulations, the NMPC is tested to traverse a set of pallets of different sizes, to walk into a V-shaped chimney, and to locomote over rough terrain. In real experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our NMPC with the mobility feature that allowed IIT's 87 kg quadruped robot HyQ to achieve an omni-directional walk on flat terrain, to traverse a static pallet, and to adapt to a repositioned pallet during a walk.","Rathod, Niraj;Bratta, Angelo;Focchi, Michele;Zanon, Mario;Villarreal, Octavio;Semini, Claudio;Bemporad, Alberto",57224728132;57219433911;36463353500;55375650900;57220113198;24924037600;7005030586

We use a nonlinear four-wheel vehicle dynamics model that includes load transfer. To overcome the computational difficulties we propose to use the ACADO Code Generation tool which generates NMPC algorithms based on the real-time iteration scheme for dynamic optimization. The exported plain C code is tailored to the model dynamics, resulting in faster run-times in effort for real-time feasibility. The advantages of the proposed method are shown through simulation. © 2013 EUCA.","Frasch, Janick V.;Gray, Andrew;Zanon, Mario;Ferreau, Hans Joachim;Sager, Sebastian;Borrelli, Francesco;Diehl, Moritz",37079171400;55489164000;55375650900;23011614500;16313801300;35768822200;7005392102
10.23919/ecc.2013.6669670,34,"Optimal control is recognized by the Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) community as a crucial tool for the development of the AWE industry. More specifically, the optimization of AWE systems for power generation is required to achieve the performance needed for their industrial viability. Models for AWE systems are highly nonlinear coupled systems. As a result, the optimization of power generation based on Newton-type techniques requires a very good initial guess. Such initial guess, however, is generally not available. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a homotopy strategy based on the relaxation of the dynamic constraints of the optimization problem. The relaxed problem differs from the original one only by a single parameter, which is gradually modified to obtain the solution to the original problem. © 2013 EUCA.","Gros, Sebastien;Zanon, M.;Diehl, Moritz",55694310100;55375650900;7005392102
10.1109/acc.2012.6315367,13,"The Airborne Wind Energy paradigm proposes to generate energy by flying a tethered airfoil across the wind flow. An essential problem posed by Airborne Wind Energy is the control of the tethered airfoil trajectory during power generation. Tethered flight is a fast, strongly nonlinear, unstable and constrained process, motivating control approaches based on fast Nonlinear Model Predictive Control. In this paper, a computationally efficient 6-DOF control model for a high performance, large-scale, rigid airfoil is proposed. A control scheme based on receding-horizon Nonlinear Model Predictive Control to track reference trajectories is applied to the proposed model. In order to make a real-time application of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control possible, a Real-Time Iteration scheme is proposed and its performance investigated. © 2012 AACC American Automatic Control Council).","Gros, Sebastien;Zanon, Mario;Diehl, Moritz",55694310100;55375650900;7005392102
10.3182/20120823-5-NL-3013.00061,28,"Mechanical applications often require a high control frequency to cope with fast dynamics. The control frequency of a nonlinear model predictive controller depends strongly on the symbolic complexity of the equations modeling the system. The symbolic complexity of the model equations for multi-body mechanical systems can often be dramatically reduced by using representations based on non-minimal coordinates, which result in index-3 differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). This paper proposes a general procedure to efficiently treat multi-body mechanical systems in the context of MHE & NMPC using non-minimal coordinate representations, and provides the resulting computational times that can be achieved on a tethered airplane system using code generation. © 2012 IFAC.","Gros, Śebastien;Zanon, Mario;Vukov, Milan;Diehl, Moritz",55694310100;55375650900;55375340400;7005392102

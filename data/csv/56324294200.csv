10.3390/ijerph19095085,4,"Since the end of 2019 and throughout 2020, the world has been devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The sports world suddenly had to deal with a massive reorganization of events with important implications for the physical and psychological preparation of athletes and coaches. The purpose of this study was to explore how these changes impacted coaches’ and ath-letes’ goal-setting strategies and their experience of goal adjustment. As part of a wider mixed-method project involving 2162 coaches and 1354 athletes, an online qualitative survey was used, and data collected were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. Findings highlighted three overarching themes, in response to goal adjustment: “Moving on toward new goals”, “Let-ting go of goals”, and “Trying to hold on”, with several themes and sub-themes identifying different nuances of athletes’ and coaches’ experiences. The implications of such findings for the mental preparation of high-level athletes are discussed in two ways. Firstly, in light of existing literature on goal setting from an applied perspective; secondly, in the broader perspective of the sports culture and the application of our themes to other challenging moments that sports profes-sionals might encounter.","Costa, Sergio;De Gregorio, Eugenio;Zurzolo, Lisa;Santi, Giampaolo;Ciofi, Edoardo Giorgio;Di Gruttola, Francesco;Morgilli, Luana;Montesano, Cristina;Cavallerio, Francesca;Bertollo, Maurizio;Di Fronso, Selenia",57197392676;36702492800;57605915100;57904676200;57218436833;56324294200;57218437577;57215590419;57189233335;14039954100;55839710400

In this study, we compared the predictive power of different classes of models, i.e., (i) traditional Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), with two families of Machine Learning algorithms: (ii) regressors, specifically least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) for feature selection and (iii) classifiers, specifically Bagging meta-model with the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) as a base estimator. Our aim is to investigate which method better predicts job satisfaction for 348 employees (with operational duties) and 35 supervisors in the training set, and 79 employees in the test set, all subject to internal mobility programs in a large Italian banking group. Results showed average predictive power for SEM and Bagging k-NN (accuracy between 61 and 66%; F1 scores between 0.51 and 0.73). Both SEM and Lasso algorithms highlighted the predictive power of resistance to change and orientation to relation in all models, together with other personality and motivation variables in different models. Theoretical implications are discussed for using these variables in predicting successful job relocation in internal mobility programs. Moreover, these results showed how crucial it is to compare methods coming from different research traditions in predictive Human Resources analytics.","Bossi, Francesco;Di Gruttola, Francesco;Mastrogiorgio, Antonio;D'Arcangelo, Sonia;Lattanzi, Nicola;Malizia, Andrea P.;Ricciardi, Emiliano",56963595100;56324294200;56072400100;57221913690;56136055200;16028897900;8565770200
10.1080/1612197X.2020.1802612,139,"Italy was one of the most impacted countries by the COVID-19 crisis, with detrimental effects on the world of sports. In this exploratory study, we examined Italian athletes’ perceived stress and functional/dysfunctional psychobiosocial states during the COVID-19 crisis, comparing current assessment scores with data collected prior to the pandemic. Differences by gender, sport (i.e., individual vs team sport), and competitive level (elite/expert vs novice athletes) were also examined. The perceived stress scale and the psychobiosocial states scale were administered to 1132 competitive athletes about one month after the beginning of Italian lockdown. The comparison between the data collected during COVID-19 with the data collected before the pandemic outbreak revealed highly significant differences with medium to large effects sizes. Findings suggest that the COVID-19 crisis increased athletes’ perceived stress and dysfunctional psychobiosocial states, while decreased functional psychobiosocial states. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences by gender on perceived stress and both types of psychobiosocial states, as well as by competitive level on perceived stress and functional psychobiosocial states. Specifically, women reported higher perceived stress and dysfunctional psychobiosocial states scores than men, and lower functional psychobiosocial states scores. Elite/expert athletes reported lower perceived stress and higher functional psychobiosocial states scores than novice athletes. From a practical point of view, training regimens and healthy behaviours during pandemic crises should be introduced as standard habits for health and well-being. The application of specific well-being protocols for women and novice athletes should be encouraged.","di Fronso, Selenia;Costa, Sergio;Montesano, Cristina;Di Gruttola, Francesco;Ciofi, Edoardo Giorgio;Morgilli, Luana;Robazza, Claudio;Bertollo, Maurizio",55839710400;57197392676;57215590419;56324294200;57218436833;57218437577;6603960972;14039954100
10.3389/fnins.2020.577978,6,"The frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) is a neurophysiological measure of motivation and preference. Despite the FAA is associated to commercial pleasantness, conflicting evidence emerged in the literature regarding its relationship with behavior. To study the association between FAA and consumers' decision, we manipulated a commercial script to elicit diverse consumers' attitudes and decisions and to evaluate whether the FAA score is associated to their final investment. A little informative script (S1) was used to polarize consumers' attitudes and investments toward unfavorable scores, while a more personalized message (S2) to elicit in customers a favorable attitude and higher investments. Twenty-one participants listened to the scripts, and their FAA, attitude, and monetary investment were measured. In S1, the FAA did not correlate with neither attitude nor the investment decision, while a robust negative correlation between these variables was found in S2. No other peripheral body and neural measures associated with attitude or final decision. Our data suggest that the FAA correlates with attitude and decision, when a commercial script is customized and provides an adequate information, likely leading the consumer to a more reasoned and planned decision-making process. When facilitating a favorable attitude toward an offer, the negative correlation of FAA and behavior may reflect the involvement of a control system, whose role is to monitor and govern possible conflicts between approach and avoidance motivations. This observation provides additional indication on the value of FAA as a marker of consumer behaviors, and how it could be affected by experimental and contextual bias.","Di Gruttola, Francesco;Malizia, Andrea P.;D'Arcangelo, Sonia;Lattanzi, Nicola;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Orfei, Maria Donata",56324294200;16028897900;57221913690;56136055200;8565770200;57192322263
10.3389/fpsyg.2020.601743,27,"The recent global outspread of the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the lives of people across multiple countries including athletes, coaches, and supporting staff. Along with everybody else, coaches found themselves constrained to an at-home self-isolation, which limited their ability to normally engage with their profession and to interact with their athletes. This situation may also have impacted their own psychological well-being. With this study, we explored coaches’ perceptions of stress in relation to their emotion regulation strategies depending upon their gender and competitive level (elite vs. non-elite). A sample of 2272 Italian coaches were surveyed during the period of lockdown. Mean values for perceived stress and emotion regulation strategies were compared to normative data of the two instruments as reported in the original studies. Furthermore, two Multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) were completed to observe the potential differences in the coaches’ emotion regulation strategies and perception of stress. Finally, a blockwise regression analysis was run to assess how coaches’ emotion regulation strategies impacted upon their perception of stress. Both women and men reported higher levels of perceived stress than those reported in the normative data. Similarly, average scores for emotion regulation strategies were significantly different from those reported for normative data, in particular, coaches reported slightly higher use of emotion regulation strategies than participants in the original study. Significant gender-based differences emerged in terms of emotional regulations, with men adopting more suppression than women. No differences by competitive level were found. In terms of perceived stress, male coaches and elite coaches showed to be more in control of the situation (positive stress) than female coaches and non-elite coaches, respectively, while women experienced more negative stress than men. The blockwise regression evidenced how reappraisal resulted to be predictive in helping coaches to reduce their perception of stress, while suppression predicted higher stress perceptions.","Santi, Giampaolo;Quartiroli, Alessandro;Costa, Sergio;di Fronso, Selenia;Montesano, Cristina;Di Gruttola, Francesco;Ciofi, Edoardo Giorgio;Morgilli, Luana;Bertollo, Maurizio",57904676200;35849196100;57197392676;55839710400;57215590419;56324294200;57218436833;57218437577;14039954100
10.1007/s11332-020-00677-9,51,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted on the sporting field, with athletes constrained in home isolation without the possibility to train and compete in their usual environments. This situation has been investigated within the theoretical frameworks of athletic identity and cognitive emotion regulation. Objectives: The objectives of our investigation were to: (a) validate the athletic identity measurement scale (AIMS) for use in Italian language; and (b) explore differences by gender, typology of sport (individual vs. team), and competitive level (elite vs. non-elite) in athletic identity and in cognitive emotion regulation during the Covid-19 lockdown period. Methods: To achieve these objectives, the reliability and construct validity of the Italian version of the AIMS have been tested in Study 1. Multivariate and univariate analyses were run to evaluate differences between different groups of athletes in Study 2. Results: Results from Study 1 suggest a 3-factor higher order model of athletic identity. Results from Study 2 highlight that, during this lockdown period, elite athletes and team sports athletes show higher athletic identity. Cognitive emotion regulation strategies are different for gender and for competitive level. Finally, athletes with higher athletic identity tend to ruminate and catastrophize more. Conclusions: The present multi-study paper contributes to the theoretical field with a validated measure of athletic identity in Italian language. It also provides some practical implications that could apply in this situation of isolation and can be extended to cases such as those of injury or illness.","Costa, Sergio;Santi, Giampaolo;di Fronso, Selenia;Montesano, Cristina;Di Gruttola, Francesco;Ciofi, Edoardo Giorgio;Morgilli, Luana;Bertollo, Maurizio",57197392676;57904676200;55839710400;57215590419;56324294200;57218436833;57218437577;14039954100
10.1016/j.neuroscience.2020.07.038,6,"Motor imagery (MI) ability is highly subjective, as indicated by the individual scores of the MIQ-3 questionnaire, and poor imagers compensate for the difficulty in performing MI with larger cerebral activations, as demonstrated by MI studies involving hands/limbs. In order to identify general, task-independent MI ability correlates, 16 volunteers were stratified with MIQ-3. The scores in the kinaesthetic (K) and 1st-person visual (V) perspectives were associated with EEG patterns obtained during K-MI and V-MI of the same complex MIQ-3 movements during these MI tasks (Spearman's correlation, significance at <0.05, SnPM corrected). EEG measures were relative to rest (relaxation, closed eyes), and based on six electrode clusters both for band spectral content and connectivity (Granger causality). Lower K-MI ability was associated with greater theta decreases during tasks in fronto-central clusters and greater inward information flow to prefrontal clusters for theta, high alpha and beta bands. On the other hand, power band relative decreases were associated with V-MI ability in fronto-central clusters for low alpha and left fronto-central and both centro-parietal clusters for beta bands. The results thus suggest different computational mechanisms for MI-V and MI-K. The association between low alpha/beta desynchronization and V-MIQ scores and between theta changes and K-MIQ scores suggest a cognitive effort with greater cerebral activation in participants with lower V-MI ability. The association between information flow to prefrontal hub and K-MI ability suggest the need for a continuous update of information to support MI-related executive functions in subjects with poor K-MI ability.","Menicucci, Danilo;Di Gruttola, Francesco;Cesari, Valentina;Gemignani, Angelo;Manzoni, Diego;Sebastiani, Laura",57192785554;56324294200;57215269059;8866128900;7004282360;7005330284
10.3389/fnins.2019.01431,15,"This study investigates the assessment of motor imagery (MI) ability in humans. Commonly, MI ability is measured through two methodologies: a self-administered questionnaire (MIQ-3) and the mental chronometry (MC), which measures the temporal discrepancy between the actual and the imagined motor tasks. However, both measures rely on subjects' self-assessment and do not use physiological measures. In this study, we propose a novel set of features extracted from the nonlinear dynamics of the eye gaze signal to discriminate between good and bad imagers. To this aim, we designed an experiment where twenty volunteers, categorized as good or bad imagers according to MC, performed three tasks: a motor task (MT), a visual Imagery task (VI), and a kinaesthetic Imagery task (KI). Throughout the experiment, the subjects' eye gaze was continuously monitored using an eye-tracking system. Eye gaze time series were analyzed through recurrence quantification analysis of the reconstructed phase space and compared between the two groups. Statistical results have shown how nonlinear eye behavior can express an inner dynamics of imagery mental process and may be used as a more objective and physiological-based measure of MI ability.","Lanata, Antonio;Sebastiani, Laura;Di Gruttola, Francesco;Di Modica, Stefano;Scilingo, Enzo Pasquale;Greco, Alberto",22734018500;7005330284;56324294200;57214454576;6601971636;56854902700
10.1016/j.neulet.2018.10.039,2,"Hypnotizability is a psychophysiological trait associated with morpho-functional brain differences. Since also cerebellar peculiarities have been reported in individuals with different hypnotizability levels and the cerebellar function is relevant to spatial imagery, the present study was aimed at investigating possible hypnotizability-related differences in the ability of spatial imagery. Highly (highs, N = 31), low (lows, N = 17) and medium (mediums, N = 16) hypnotizable participants (classified by Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale, form A) of both genders were submitted to a test of mental rotation, which requires the integrity of both executive and cerebellar structures. In order to disentangle the role of the cerebellum from that of executive circuits as much as possible, visuospatial and verbal working memory tests, which mainly reflect executive processes, were also performed. Healthy highs exhibited higher scores of mental rotation ability compared to mediums in the absence of significant differences in visual-spatial and verbal working memory. Lows reported intermediate scores not significantly different from both highs’ and mediums’. Different cognitive strategies were observed in the three groups as the correlations between mental rotation, visuospatial and verbal working memory were different in highs, mediums and lows. In conclusion, present findings represent the first report of hypnotizability-related differences in a mental rotation task, which is relevant to several cognitive functions.","Incognito, Oriana;Menardo, Elisa;Di Gruttola, Francesco;Tomaiuolo, Francesco;Sebastiani, Laura;Santarcangelo, Enrica L.",57192707370;57090842500;56324294200;6701349113;7005330284;6602881192

,1,"Questionnaires are presented as reliable measure of motor imagery (MI), i.e. the ability to mentally simulate a movement in an internal perspective. Although there is some evidence that MI is domain-specific (i.e., i.e., higher scores for motor imagery may be generated by people with extensive real-world experience and practice), MI studies have typically employed fixed and generic movements as items. Thus, we investigated the content validity of the movement items of the Vividness of Movement Imagery Questionnaire-2 (VMIQ-2). Sixty participants were divided in groups of athletes (competitive and not-competitive, with an extensive motor experience) and not-athletes (with a reduced motor experience) and analysed by means of a mixed factorial MANOVA. The three MI modalities, external visual, internal visual and kinesthetic imagery, did not result in significantly different scores between the groups. We recommend caution in using MI generic questionnaires in studies that compare people with different motor experiences. Moreover, we suggest that the structure of the questionnaires should be redesigned, in order to make them adaptable to the specific needs of professionals and researchers.","Di Gruttola, Francesco;Sebastian, Laura",56324294200;57195315660
10.1007/s00221-014-4073-z,12,"Blink rate (BR), which is considered an index of the dopaminergic tone, has been studied in 41 subjects with high (highs), medium (mediums) and low (lows) hypnotisability scores in resting conditions. It has been found higher in highs; relaxation (indicated by skin conductance), anxiety and the proneness to absorption in tasks (assessed by questionnaires) were not responsible for the observed difference. In contrast, the BR difference did not survive controlling for mind wandering (MW questionnaire) whose variability could account for contrasting earlier reports, although no significant hypnotisability-related difference has been observed in MW scores. Findings do not allow to exclude that mechanisms other than dopaminergic ones may be involved in the observed difference in BR. In particular, we suggest that one of the mechanisms possibly sustaining the highs’ higher BR may be a reduced cerebellar inhibition. In fact, cerebellar impairment is associated with higher BR and several studies of sensorimotor integration indicate different cerebellar controls in the highs’ and lows’ behavior.","Di Gruttola, Francesco;Orsini, Paolo;Carboncini, Maria C.;Rossi, Bruno;Santarcangelo, Enrica L.",56324294200;7005367791;6602689035;7101881488;6602881192

10.3390/ijerph20176634,0,"Cognitive insight refers to the ability to question one’s judgments and cognitive biases and is underpinned by specific metacognitive processes. The Beck Cognitive Insight Scale was developed to assess cognitive insight and includes two subscales, Self-Reflectiveness and Self-Certainty (SC). The present study aimed to investigate the underlying factor structure of the Italian version of the BCIS in patients with schizophrenia (SZ) and in the general population (GP) for the first time. A cross-sectional design was adopted and a GP sample of 624 subjects and an SZ sample of 130 patients were enrolled. In the SZ group, a two-factor solution was supported. The internal reliability of each factor was satisfactory. Two items were eliminated and one item moved from the SC to the SR subscale. In the GP group, a two-factor solution was highlighted. The internal reliability of each factor was satisfactory. However, four items of the SR subscale were deleted. The Italian-validated version of the BCIS shows different structures for the SZ and the GP and is characterized by different features concerning previous studies. This evidence suggests new interpretations of metacognitive processes in the two populations and implies specific therapeutic approaches.","Orfei, Maria Donata;Porcari, Desirée Estela;Spalletta, Gianfranco;Assogna, Francesca;Piras, Fabrizio;Banaj, Nerisa;Ricciardi, Emiliano",57192322263;57220078252;57201126550;24528556300;57576967000;56194289200;8565770200
10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1253960,0,"Introduction: Technostress (TS) represents a multidimensional phenomenon closely related to the pervasive use of information and communication technologies. This study aimed to validate a new psychometric tool for assessing TS in an Italian banking context, the Work-Related Technostress – Questionnaire (WRT-Q). Secondly, we analyzed the role of gender and age in modulating TS manifestations. Methods: A sample of 2,586 bank employees (51% females; age: 47.26 ± 8.6) underwent an online survey. Reliability, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), ANCOVA, independent sample t-test, and correlation analyses were performed. Results: The WRT-Q consisted of 17 items and a four-factor structure, supported by the following CFA indices: Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0.985; Incremental Fit Index (IFI) = 0.985; Goodness of Fit (GFI) = 0.988; Root Mean Squared Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.071; and SRMR = 0.062. A significant difference in TS levels between age classes emerged (p < 0.001) with higher levels in the over 55-year-old subgroup, while no statistically significant difference emerged for gender. Moreover, the whole sample found a significant positive association between age and TS (p < 0.001). Discussion: The WRT-Q is a new instrument to measure TS in the workplace, it can contribute to highlighting adverse outcomes in individuals due to a dysfunctional interaction with ICT.","Porcari, Desirée Estela;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Orfei, Maria Donata",57220078252;8565770200;57192322263

The present study had the objective to develop training to facilitate the management of work-related technostress. A sample of 236 voluntary bank employees underwent an initial survey and a training protocol to mitigate and relieve technostress effects. Finally, they filled in the survey again. Within-group analyses were performed comparing pre- against post-training scores. Furthermore, between-group analyses compared the post-training results of the experimental group to those of a control group that answered the initial survey, but did not perform the training. Results showed that in the experimental group, the post-training levels of technostress were reduced with respect to pre-training scores and were lower than in the control group. Our data showed that a multifaceted approach could stimulate the development of effective screening procedures and intervention strategies to enhance a healthy interaction between individuals and IT.","Orfei, Maria Donata;Porcari, Desirèè Estela;D’Arcangelo, Sonia;Maggi, Francesca;Russignaga, Dario;Ricciardi, Emiliano",57192322263;57220078252;57463509700;57232266500;6506912623;8565770200
10.3390/jcm11195529,8,"Epidemiological data and etiopathogenesis of brain fog are very heterogeneous in the literature, preventing adequate diagnosis and treatment. Our study aimed to explore the relationship between brain fog, neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms in the general population. A sample of 441 subjects underwent a web-based survey, including the PANAS, the DASS-21, the IES-R, the Beck Cognitive Insight Scale, and a questionnaire investigating demographic information, brain fog, subjective cognitive impairments (Scc) and sleep disorders. ANOVA, ANCOVA, correlation and multiple stepwise regression analyses were performed. In our sample, 33% of participants were defined as Healthy Subjects (HS; no brain fog, no Scc), 27% as Probable Brain Fog (PBF; brain fog or Scc), and 40% as Functional Brain Fog (FBF; brain fog plus Scc). PBF and FBF showed higher levels of neuropsychiatric symptoms than HS, and FBF showed the worst psychological outcome. Moreover, worse cognitive symptoms were related to the female gender, greater neuropsychiatric symptoms, sleep disorders, and rumination/indecision. Being a woman and more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms were predictors of FBF severity. Our data pointed out a high prevalence and various levels of severity and impairments of brain fog, suggesting a classificatory proposal and a multifaceted etiopathogenic model, thus facilitating adequate diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","Orfei, Maria Donata;Porcari, Desirée Estela;D’Arcangelo, Sonia;Maggi, Francesca;Russignaga, Dario;Ricciardi, Emiliano",57192322263;57220078252;57463509700;57232266500;6506912623;8565770200
10.3389/fpsyg.2022.843095,14,"The COVID-19 evolution has forced the massive introduction of homeworking (HW) for most employees in the initial stages of the pandemic and then return to work, mainly due to the vaccination campaign. These multiple abrupt adjustment demands in work may be a source of intense stress for office workers with consequences on wellbeing and the quality of life. This long-term prospective study aimed at investigating the effect of adaptation demands on a broad population of employees of a large Italian banking group in the job-related stress framework. We administered a web-based survey to 1,264 participants in Reopening after the first lockdown, from June to October 2020, at 841 subjects in Second Wave, corresponding to the rise of contagions from November 2020 to January 2021, and to 491 individuals in Vaccination Round, which ranged from February to June 2021. We assessed workaholism by using the Dutch Work Addiction Scale (DUWAS-10), work-family conflicting overlap by using the Work and Family Conflict Scale (WAFCS), and concern for back to work (BW) and for HW by specific questions. Higher WAFCS scores characterized Reopening and Vaccination Round while Second Wave had the highest level of concern for HW. Women and younger individuals showed the highest concern for BW, WAFCS, and DUWAS-10 scores regardless of the pandemic stage. HW days per week were related to more heightened concern for BW and lower concern for HW, DUWAS, and WAFCS scores. The number of children was related to lower Concern for BW and higher WAFCS scores in Reopening and Second Wave. Our data showed that massive adjustment demands in work and family routine represented a significant source of stress for employees, regardless of the different pandemic stages. The highest level of fatigue emerged in women and younger subjects. These results shed light on the need for a road map to promote a gradual and structured adjustment for workers and encourage organizations to consider homeworking as a valid stable alternative.","Orfei, Maria Donata;Porcari, Desirée Estela;D’Arcangelo, Sonia;Maggi, Francesca;Russignaga, Dario;Lattanzi, Nicola;Malizia, Andrea Patricelli;Ricciardi, Emiliano",57192322263;57220078252;57463509700;57232266500;6506912623;56136055200;16028897900;8565770200
10.23736/S0026-4806.21.07571-6,17,"Current investigations in pre-symptomatic dementia have suggested that depressive mood, a treatable condition, may play an important role in the development of the disorder. However, whether depression in adulthood constitute a risk factor, or a prodrome of dementia remains unclear. A major implication in such dispute is the analytic framework used to identify putative risk factors. Indeed, if evaluated in the years immediately prior to dementia diagnosis the association between depression and dementia may reflect depressive symptoms as a prodrome of yet-undiagnosed dementia. Unfortunately, long term prospective cohort investigations, reaching back into the preclinical phase of dementia are sparse. Here, we have surveyed high-quality evidence (systematic reviews and meta-analyses) on the association between depressive symptoms and increased odds of dementia. Meta-analytic findings are also presented and discussed regarding depression as a prodromal stage of dementia, or a consequence of underlying neurodegenerative processes. Additionally, the potential confounding effect of several variables on the risk association between depression and dementia, an aspect hardly investigated, is discussed. While early onset late-life depression — defined as starting before 60 years of age — increases the odds of developing dementia in predisposed subjects, late-onset depression appears to be a prodrome and a clear accelerating factor for cognitive deterioration. Since it is increasingly important to consider the potential of preemptive approaches to decrease the impact of dementia, evidence on potentially effective preventive strategies targeting depression as a risk factor, and next steps in further research are presented as concluding remarks.","Piras, Federica;Banaj, Nerisa;Porcari, Desirée E.;Piras, Fabrizio;Spalletta, Gianfranco",35746761500;56194289200;57220078252;57576967000;57201126550
10.3389/fnagi.2021.653533,29,"Background: Family caregivers of patients with dementia are at high risk of stress and burden, and quarantine due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have increased the risk of psychological disturbances in this population. The current study was carried out during the national lockdown declared in March 2020 by the Italian government as a containment measure of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic and is the first nationwide survey on the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the mental health of dementia informal caregivers. Methods: Eighty-seven dementia centers evenly distributed on the Italian territory enrolled 4,710 caregiver–patient pairs. Caregivers underwent a telephone interview assessing classical symptoms of caregiver stress and concern for the consequences of COVID-19 infection on patient’s health. We calculated prevalence of symptoms and regressed them on various potential stress risk factors: caregivers’ sociodemographic characteristics and lifestyle, patients’ clinical features, and lockdown-related elements, like discontinuity in medical care. Results: Approximately 90% of caregivers reported at least one symptom of stress, and nearly 30% reported four or more symptoms. The most prevalent symptoms were concern for consequences of COVID-19 on patient’s health (75%) and anxiety (46%). The main risk factors for stress were identified as a conflicting relationship with the patient and discontinuity in assistance, but caregiver’s female sex, younger age, lower education, and cohabitation with the patient also had an impact. Availability of help from institutions or private individuals showed a protective effect against sense of abandonment but a detrimental effect on concern about the risk for the patient to contract COVID-19. The only protective factor was mild dementia severity, which was associated with a lower risk of feeling isolated and abandoned; type of dementia, on the other hand, did not affect stress risk. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the large prevalence of stress in family caregivers of patients with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic and have identified both caregivers and situations at a higher risk of stress, which should be taken into account in the planning of interventions in support of quarantined families and patients.","Zucca, Milena;Isella, Valeria;Lorenzo, Raffaele Di;Marra, Camillo;Cagnin, Annachiara;Cupidi, Chiara;Bonanni, Laura;Laganà, Valentina;Rubino, Elisa;Vanacore, Nicola;Agosta, Federica;Caffarra, Paolo;Sambati, Renato;Quaranta, Davide;Guglielmi, Valeria;Appollonio, Ildebrando M.;Logroscino, Giancarlo;Filippi, Massimo;Tedeschi, Gioacchino;Ferrarese, Carlo;Rainero, Innocenzo;Bruni, Amalia C.;Gallo, Erica;Grassini, Alberto;Marcinnò, Andrea;Roveta, Fausto;Martino, Paola De;Frangipane, Francesca;Puccio, Gianfranco;Colao, Rosanna;Mirabelli, Maria;Martellacci, Noemi;Lino, Federica;Mozzetta, Stefano;Bussè, Cinzia;Camporese, Giulia;Sacco, Simona;Lechiara, Maria Carmela;Carrarini, Claudia;Russo, Mirella;Casalena, Alfonsina;Sucapane, Patrizia;Tiraboschi, Pietro;Caroppo, Paola;Redaelli, Veronica;Fede, Giuseppe Di;Coppa, Daniela;Peluso, Lenino;Insarda, Pasqualina;Bartolo, Matteo De;Esposito, Sabrina;Iavarone, Alessandro;Orsini, Anna Vittoria Marta;Salvatore, Elena;Criscuolo, Chiara;Sambati, Luisa;Santoro, Rossella;Gragnaniello, Daniela;Pedriali, Ilaria;Ludovico, Livia;Chiari, Annalisa;Fabbo, Andrea;Bevilacqua, Petra;Galli, Chiara;Magarelli, Silvia;Perini, Marta;Spalletta, Gianfranco;Banaj, Nerisa;Porcari, Desirée Estela;Caruso, Giulia;Porcari, Desirée Estela;Cipollini, Virginia;Casini, Anna Rosa;Ursini, Francesca;Bruno, Giuseppe;Rozzini, Renzo;Brambilla, Michela;Magnani, Giuseppe;Caso, Francesca;Spinelli, Edoardo G.;Ramusino, Matteo Cotta;Perini, Giulia;Luzzi, Simona;Cacchiò, Gabriella;Ciccola, Alessia;Cionfrini, Lorena;Giuli, Cinzia;Fabi, Katia;Guidi, Marco;Paci, Cristina;Castellano, Annaelisa;Petrucci, Rossella;Accogli, Miriam;Carapelle, Elena;Calabrese, Gianluigi;Trevisi, Giovanna Nicoletta;Coluccia, Brigida;Giuliano, Antonella Vasquez;Caggiula, Marcella;Impagnatiello, Valentina",57111851000;6602361312;57222392065;7102675596;12778956300;14059856700;6603146272;57193822544;8918035400;7004434355;6701687853;7003351095;6506326175;24178705000;57193220060;8309607400;7004888005;7202268530;7102955116;7005869087;7003753505;7102347222;57220078269;57220078447;57199191806;57204917252;57226511516;14048256400;13006379400;6506732115;56689705200;57220078480;57220078277;57220078341;56376496000;57191338072;55751819500;6507601039;57206848571;57206855020;36871727400;14050772600;6701774925;57203163725;56820117200;57220098933;57220078243;57220078596;57213899469;56218360500;57211005485;7003290357;57203890657;6603590758;6602940785;35604459700;57226264010;19434106600;54682172900;57190381391;12792407200;57128458500;56950215600;57217793226;57220078602;57220078245;57201126550;56194289200;58583514900;57201436897;57220078252;55444198300;57196869999;35094514900;7202705363;7005933192;55109120300;24496141800;35785657000;55372514300;57211850060;56441151600;56264790400;23024298600;26030246800;58379622000;24372780400;23110360200;26661244600;6603834356;7005238614;57196717506;57217284869;55628882400;58709879200;57220078213;57220078717;57532490200;6505937835;57226513152
10.3389/fnagi.2020.625781,76,"Introduction: Previous studies showed that quarantine for pandemic diseases is associated with several psychological and medical effects. The consequences of quarantine for COVID-19 pandemic in patients with dementia are unknown. We investigated the clinical changes in patients with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, and evaluated caregivers’ distress during COVID-19 quarantine. Methods: The study involved 87 Italian Dementia Centers. Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and Vascular Dementia (VD) were eligible for the study. Family caregivers of patients with dementia were interviewed by phone in April 2020, 45 days after quarantine declaration. Main outcomes were patients’ changes in cognitive, behavioral, and motor symptoms. Secondary outcomes were effects on caregivers’ psychological features. Results: 4913 patients (2934 females, 1979 males) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Caregivers reported a worsening in cognitive functions in 55.1% of patients, mainly in subjects with DLB and AD. Aggravation of behavioral symptoms was observed in 51.9% of patients. In logistic regression analysis, previous physical independence was associated with both cognitive and behavioral worsening (odds ratio 1.85 [95% CI 1.42–2.39], 1.84 [95% CI 1.43–2.38], respectively). On the contrary, pandemic awareness was a protective factor for the worsening of cognitive and behavioral symptoms (odds ratio 0.74 [95% CI 0.65–0.85]; and 0.72 [95% CI 0.63–0.82], respectively). Approximately 25.9% of patients showed the onset of new behavioral symptoms. A worsening in motor function was reported by 36.7% of patients. Finally, caregivers reported a high increase in anxiety, depression, and distress. Conclusion: Our study shows that quarantine for COVID-19 is associated with an acute worsening of clinical symptoms in patients with dementia as well as increase of caregivers’ burden. Our findings emphasize the importance to implement new strategies to mitigate the effects of quarantine in patients with dementia.","Rainero, Innocenzo;Bruni, Amalia C.;Marra, Camillo;Cagnin, Annachiara;Bonanni, Laura;Cupidi, Chiara;Laganà, Valentina;Rubino, Elisa;Vacca, Alessandro;Lorenzo, Raffaele Di;Provero, Paolo;Isella, Valeria;Vanacore, Nicola;Agosta, Federica;Appollonio, Ildebrando;Caffarra, Paolo;Bussè, Cinzia;Sambati, Renato;Quaranta, Davide;Guglielmi, Valeria;Logroscino, Giancarlo;Filippi, Massimo;Tedeschi, Gioacchino;Ferrarese, Carlo;Gallo, Erica;Grassini, Alberto;Marcinnò, Andrea;Roveta, Fausto;De Martino, Paola;Frangipane, Francesca;Puccio, Gianfranco;Colao, Rosanna;Mirabelli, Maria;Terracciano, Chiara;Lino, Federica;Mozzetta, Stefano;Gazzola, Gianmarco;Camporese, Giulia;Sacco, Simona;Lechiara, Maria Carmela;Carrarini, Claudia;Russo, Mirella;Casa Lena, Alfonsina;Sucapane, Patrizia;Tiraboschi, Pietro;Caroppo, Paola;Redaelli, Veronica;Di Fede, Giuseppe;Coppa, Daniela;Peluso, Lenino;Insarda, Pasqualina;De Bartolo, Matteo;Esposito, Sabrina;Iavarone, Alessandro;Fuschillo, Carmine;Salvatore, Elena;Criscuolo, Chiara;Sambati, Luisa;Santoro, Rossella;Gragnaniello, Daniela;Pedriali, Ilaria;Ludovico, Livia;Chiari, Annalisa;Fabbo, Andrea;Bevilacqua, Petra;Galli, Chiara;Magarelli, Silvia;Spalletta, Gianfranco;Banaj, Nerisa;Caruso, Giulia;Estela Porcari, Desirée;Giubilei, Franco;Casini, Anna Rosa;Ursini, Francesca;Bruno, Giuseppe;Boffelli, Stefano;Brambilla, Michela;Magnani, Giuseppe;Caso, Francesca;Spinelli, Edoardo G.;Sinforiani, Elena;Costa, Alfredo;Luzzi, Simona;Cacchiò, Gabriella;Perini, Marta;Angeloni, Rossano;Giuli, Cinzia;Fabi, Katia;Guidi, Marco;Paci, Cristina;Castellano, Annaelisa;Carapelle, Elena;Petrucci, Rossella;Accogli, Miriam;Nicoletta Trevisi, Giovanna;Renna, Serena;Giuliano, Antonella Vasquez;Da Re, Fulvio;Milia, Antonio;Pilia, Giuseppina",7003753505;7102347222;7102675596;12778956300;6603146272;14059856700;57193822544;8918035400;55700029800;57222392065;55840319900;6602361312;7004434355;6701687853;8309607400;7003351095;56376496000;6506326175;24178705000;57193220060;7004888005;7202268530;7102955116;7005869087;57220078269;57220078447;57199191806;57204917252;7801586295;14048256400;13006379400;6506732115;56689705200;58564785400;57220078277;57220078341;57212397274;57191338072;55751819500;6507601039;57206848571;57206855020;57222392366;14050772600;6701774925;57203163725;56820117200;7003846313;57220078243;57220078596;57213899469;56218360500;57211005485;7003290357;6603363045;6603590758;6602940785;35604459700;57226264010;19434106600;54682172900;57190381391;12792407200;57128458500;56950215600;57217793226;57220078602;57201126550;56194289200;57201436897;57220078252;7003924434;57196869999;35094514900;7202705363;6602338018;55109120300;24496141800;35785657000;55372514300;7004048043;35499758300;56264790400;23024298600;57220078245;57205709637;24372780400;23110360200;26661244600;6603834356;7005238614;55628882400;57196717506;57217284869;57220078213;57222393232;57532490200;56582222400;36765409300;23051690800
10.3389/fpsyt.2020.599844,20,"Background: In the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, many countries made changes to the routine management of patients with non-communicable diseases, including neurocognitive disorders. Therefore, many “so-called” non-urgent elective procedures and outpatient appointments have been canceled or postponed, possibly impacting negatively on health and well-being of patients in the short- and long-term. Aim: Here, we aimed at describing numbers and types of outpatient appointments canceled as a result of government's restrictive measures in our memory clinic. Methods: The scheduled appointments at the memory clinic of the Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS, Rome, Italy, are recorded in a comprehensive dataset under strict administrative control. Here, we compared appointments (first-time and follow-up) that were canceled from January to April 2020 with those of the corresponding months in 2019. Results: We observed a substantial decrease in appointments during 2020. The majority of scheduled appointments were follow-up, and about a quarter were first-time appointments. We estimated that 66.7% and 77.4% of patients missed out respectively their first and follow-up appointments in our memory clinic due to government's restrictive measures in March–April 2020. Conclusions: A large number of patients with neurocognitive disorders missed crucial appointments due to government's restrictive measures, and many experienced a delay in initial diagnosis and initiation of treatment. This has relevant impact on their treatment and consequently has (is still having and potentially will have) an increase on the healthcare service burden of clinics. Furthermore, as a second wave of COVID-19 affects Europe, and with winter approaching, it is a compelling priority to ensure easy and rapid access to appropriate assessment, care and treatment in the event of a new outbreak and potential subsequent lockdowns, with particular attention to the development of specific healthcare technologies customized to older persons with cognitive impairment.","Spalletta, Gianfranco;Porcari, Desirée Estela;Banaj, Nerisa;Ciullo, Valentina;Palmer, Katie",57201126550;57220078252;56194289200;56026489000;7202292343
10.3389/fpsyt.2020.599851,6,"Background: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, many non-urgent outpatient services in Italy were closed due to the Government-enforced lockdown period. So far, little is known about what effect the pandemic, quarantine measures, and reductions in medical services had on people with cognitive impairment and their caregivers. Objectives: To develop two versions (i.e., patients and informants/caregivers) of a survey designed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during the first Italian lockdown period (11 March −4 May 2020) on Memory Clinic outpatients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or dementia, and their caregivers. Design: Psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, and epidemiologists developed two versions: one for patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment and other cognitive disorders, the other for their relatives and/or caregivers. Each version of the survey includes five sections: (a) socio-demographic information and access to technology devices; (b) individual COVID-19 protection methods; (c) knowledge about COVID-19; (d) the effect of COVID-19 on daily life; and (e) the effect of COVID-19 on emotional state. Conclusion: Until an effective vaccine is developed it is likely that future waves of COVID-19 will result in shielding of vulnerable older adults. We believe that this instrument will be useful as a tool to collect information and help clinicians to promptly respond to changes in patients' cognitive, psychiatric, and somatic health needs, and to help for future planning in possible subsequent quarantine periods.","Porcari, Desirée E.;Palmer, Katie;Spalletta, Gianfranco;Ciullo, Valentina;Banaj, Nerisa",57220078252;7202292343;57201126550;56026489000;56194289200
10.3389/fpsyt.2020.578015,131,"Background: In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic due to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and several governments planned a national quarantine in order to control the virus spread. Acute psychological effects of quarantine in frail elderly subjects with special needs, such as patients with dementia, have been poorly investigated. The aim of this study was to assess modifications of neuropsychiatric symptoms during quarantine in patients with dementia and their caregivers. Methods: This is a sub-study of a multicenter nation-wide survey. A structured telephone interview was delivered to family caregivers of patients with diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and vascular dementia (VD), followed regularly at 87 Italian memory clinics. Variations in behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD) were collected after 1 month since quarantine declaration and associations with disease type, severity, gender, and caregiver’s stress burden were analyzed. Results: A total of 4,913 caregivers participated in the survey. Increased BPSD was reported in 59.6% of patients as worsening of preexisting symptoms (51.9%) or as new onset (26%), and requested drug modifications in 27.6% of these cases. Irritability, apathy, agitation, and anxiety were the most frequently reported worsening symptoms and sleep disorder and irritability the most frequent new symptoms. Profile of BPSD varied according to dementia type, disease severity, and patients’ gender. Anxiety and depression were associated with a diagnosis of AD (OR 1.35, CI: 1.12–1.62), mild to moderate disease severity and female gender. DLB was significantly associated with a higher risk of worsening hallucinations (OR 5.29, CI 3.66–7.64) and sleep disorder (OR 1.69, CI 1.25–2.29), FTD with wandering (OR 1.62, CI 1.12–2.35), and change of appetite (OR 1.52, CI 1.03–2.25). Stress-related symptoms were experienced by two-thirds of caregivers and were associated with increased patients’ neuropsychiatric burden (p<0.0001). Conclusion: Quarantine induces a rapid increase of BPSD in approximately 60% of patients and stress-related symptoms in two-thirds of caregivers. Health services need to plan a post-pandemic strategy in order to address these emerging needs.","Cagnin, Annachiara;Di Lorenzo, Raffaele;Marra, Camillo;Bonanni, Laura;Cupidi, Chiara;Laganà, Valentina;Rubino, Elisa;Vacca, Alessandro;Provero, Paolo;Isella, Valeria;Vanacore, Nicola;Agosta, Federica;Appollonio, Ildebrando;Caffarra, Paolo;Pettenuzzo, Ilaria;Sambati, Renato;Quaranta, Davide;Guglielmi, Valeria;Logroscino, Giancarlo;Filippi, Massimo;Tedeschi, Gioacchino;Ferrarese, Carlo;Rainero, Innocenzo;Bruni, Amalia C.;Gallo, Erica;Grassini, Alberto;Marcinnò, Andrea;Roveta, Fausto;De Martino, Paola;Frangipane, Francesca;Puccio, Gianfranco;Colao, Rosanna;Mirabelli, Maria;Martellacci, Noemi;Lino, Federica;Mozzetta, Stefano;Bussè, Cinzia;Camporese, Giulia;Sacco, Simona;Lechiara, Maria Carmela;Carrarini, Claudia;Russo, Mirella;Casalena, Alfonsina;Sucapane, Patrizia;Tiraboschi, Pietro;Caroppo, Paola;Redaelli, Veronica;Di Fede, Giuseppe;Coppa, Daniela;Peluso, Lenino;Insarda, Pasqualina;De Bartolo, Matteo;Esposito, Sabrina;Iavarone, Alessandro;Orsini, Anna Vittoria Marta;Salvatore, Elena;Criscuolo, Chiara;Sambati, Luisa;Santoro, Rossella;Gragnaniello, Daniela;Pedriali, Ilaria;Ludovico, Livia;Chiari, Annalisa;Fabbo, Andrea;Bevilacqua, Petra;Galli, Chiara;Magarelli, Silvia;Perini, Marta;Spalletta, Gianfranco;Banaj, Nerisa;Porcari, Desireé Estela;Caruso, Giulia;Porcari, Desireé Estela;Cipollini, Virginia;Casini, Anna Rosa;Ursini, Francesca;Bruno, Giuseppe;Rozzini, Renzo;Brambilla, Michela;Magnani, Giuseppe;Caso, Francesca;Spinelli, Edoardo G.;Ramusino, Matteo Cotta;Perini, Giulia;Luzzi, Simona;Cacchiò, Gabriella;Angeloni, Rossano;Giuli, Cinzia;Fabi, Katia;Guidi, Marco;Paci, Cristina;Castellano, Annaelisa;Carapelle, Elena;Petrucci, Rossella;Accogli, Miriam;Calabrese, Gianluigi;Trevisi, Giovanna Nicoletta;Coluccia, Brigida;Giuliano, Antonella Vasquez;Caggiula, Marcella",12778956300;35798157600;7102675596;6603146272;14059856700;57193822544;8918035400;55700029800;55840319900;6602361312;7004434355;6701687853;8309607400;7003351095;57212394999;6506326175;24178705000;57193220060;7004888005;7202268530;7102955116;7005869087;7003753505;7102347222;57220078269;57220078447;57199191806;57204917252;7801586295;14048256400;13006379400;6506732115;56689705200;57220078480;57220078277;57220078341;56376496000;57191338072;55751819500;6507601039;57206848571;57206855020;36871727400;14050772600;6701774925;57203163725;56820117200;7003846313;57220078243;57220078596;57213899469;56218360500;57211005485;7003290357;57203890657;6603590758;6602940785;35604459700;57226264010;19434106600;54682172900;57190381391;12792407200;57128458500;56950215600;57217793226;57220078602;57220078245;57201126550;56194289200;58583514900;57201436897;57220078252;55444198300;57196869999;35094514900;7202705363;7005933192;55109120300;24496141800;35785657000;55372514300;57211850060;56441151600;56264790400;23024298600;57205709637;24372780400;23110360200;26661244600;6603834356;7005238614;55628882400;57196717506;57217284869;58709879200;57220078213;57220078717;57532490200;6505937835

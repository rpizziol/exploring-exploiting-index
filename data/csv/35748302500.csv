10.1038/s41598-023-34998-9,0,"Narratives are paradigmatic examples of natural language, where nouns represent a proxy of information. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies revealed the recruitment of temporal cortices during noun processing and the existence of a noun-specific network at rest. Yet, it is unclear whether, in narratives, changes in noun density influence the brain functional connectivity, so that the coupling between regions correlates with information load. We acquired fMRI activity in healthy individuals listening to a narrative with noun density changing over time and measured whole-network and node-specific degree and betweenness centrality. Network measures were correlated with information magnitude with a time-varying approach. Noun density correlated positively with the across-regions average number of connections and negatively with the average betweenness centrality, suggesting the pruning of peripheral connections as information decreased. Locally, the degree of the bilateral anterior superior temporal sulcus (aSTS) was positively associated with nouns. Importantly, aSTS connectivity cannot be explained by changes in other parts of speech (e.g., verbs) or syllable density. Our results indicate that the brain recalibrates its global connectivity as a function of the information conveyed by nouns in natural language. Also, using naturalistic stimulation and network metrics, we corroborate the role of aSTS in noun processing.","Mastrandrea, Rossana;Cecchetti, Luca;Lettieri, Giada;Handjaras, Giacomo;Leo, Andrea;Papale, Paolo;Gili, Tommaso;Martini, Nicola;Latta, Daniele Della;Chiappino, Dante;Pietrini, Pietro;Ricciardi, Emiliano",56150284600;56625136900;56680972900;35748302500;55311312500;57190440455;13310221100;23025355600;6507141723;8446507300;7005057128;8565770200
10.1038/s41562-022-01507-3,3,"The processing of multisensory information is based upon the capacity of brain regions, such as the superior temporal cortex, to combine information across modalities. However, it is still unclear whether the representation of coherent auditory and visual events requires any prior audiovisual experience to develop and function. Here we measured brain synchronization during the presentation of an audiovisual, audio-only or video-only version of the same narrative in distinct groups of sensory-deprived (congenitally blind and deaf) and typically developed individuals. Intersubject correlation analysis revealed that the superior temporal cortex was synchronized across auditory and visual conditions, even in sensory-deprived individuals who lack any audiovisual experience. This synchronization was primarily mediated by low-level perceptual features, and relied on a similar modality-independent topographical organization of slow temporal dynamics. The human superior temporal cortex is naturally endowed with a functional scaffolding to yield a common representation across multisensory events.","Setti, Francesca;Handjaras, Giacomo;Bottari, Davide;Leo, Andrea;Diano, Matteo;Bruno, Valentina;Tinti, Carla;Cecchetti, Luca;Garbarini, Francesca;Pietrini, Pietro;Ricciardi, Emiliano",57348732900;35748302500;24365931900;55311312500;55736418000;57194764008;7003386397;56625136900;6504829019;7005057128;8565770200
10.1007/s42761-023-00219-9,0,"A wealth of literature suggests the existence of sex differences in how emotions are experienced, recognized, expressed, and regulated. However, to what extent these differences result from the put in place of stereotypes and social rules is still a matter of debate. Literature is an essential cultural institution, a transposition of the social life of people but also of their intimate affective experiences, which can serve to address questions of psychological relevance. Here, we created a large corpus of literary fiction enriched by authors’ metadata to measure the extent to which culture influences how men and women write about emotion. Our results show that even though before the twenty-first century and across 116 countries women more than men have written about affect, starting from 2000, this difference has diminished substantially. Also, in the past, women’s narratives were more positively laden and less arousing. While the difference in arousal is ubiquitous and still present nowadays, sex differences in valence vary as a function of culture and have dissolved in recent years. Altogether, these findings suggest that historic evolution is associated with men and women writing similarly about emotions and reveal a sizable impact of culture on the affective characteristics of the lexicon.","Lettieri, Giada;Handjaras, Giacomo;Bucci, Erika;Pietrini, Pietro;Cecchetti, Luca",56680972900;35748302500;58561797100;7005057128;56625136900
10.1093/scan/nsab112,5,"In everyday life, the stream of affect results from the interaction between past experiences, expectations and the unfolding of events. How the brain represents the relationship between time and affect has been hardly explored, as it requires modeling the complexity of everyday life in the laboratory setting. Movies condense into hours a multitude of emotional responses, synchronized across subjects and characterized by temporal dynamics alike real-world experiences. Here, we use time-varying intersubject brain synchronization and real-time behavioral reports to test whether connectivity dynamics track changes in affect during movie watching. The results show that polarity and intensity of experiences relate to the connectivity of the default mode and control networks and converge in the right temporoparietal cortex. We validate these results in two experiments including four independent samples, two movies and alternative analysis workflows. Finally, we reveal chronotopic connectivity maps within the temporoparietal and prefrontal cortex, where adjacent areas preferentially encode affect at specific timescales.","Lettieri, Giada;Handjaras, Giacomo;Setti, Francesca;Cappello, Elisa Morgana;Bruno, Valentina;Diano, Matteo;Leo, Andrea;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Pietrini, Pietro;Cecchetti, Luca",56680972900;35748302500;57348732900;57348734100;57194764008;55736418000;55311312500;8565770200;7005057128;56625136900
10.3389/fpsyg.2022.798871,0,"Humans naturally perceive visual patterns in a global manner and are remarkably capable of extracting object shapes based on properties such as proximity, closure, symmetry, and good continuation. Notwithstanding the role of these properties in perceptual grouping, studies highlighted differences in disembedding performance across individuals, which are summarized by the field dependence dimension. Evidence suggests that age and educational attainment explain part of this variability, whereas the role of sex is still highly debated. Also, which stimulus features primarily influence inter-individual variations in perceptual grouping has still to be fully determined. Building upon these premises, we assessed the role of age, education level, and sex on performance at the Leuven Embedded Figure Test—a proxy of disembedding abilities—in 391 cisgender individuals. We also investigated to what extent shape symmetry, closure, complexity, and continuation relate to task accuracy. Overall, target asymmetry, closure, and good continuation with the embedding context increase task difficulty. Simpler shapes are more difficult to detect than those with more lines, yet context complexity impairs the recognition of complex targets (i.e., those with 6 lines or more) to a greater extent. Concerning demographic data, we confirm that age and educational attainment are significantly associated with disembedding abilities and reveal a perceptual advantage in males. In summary, our study further highlights the role of shape properties in disembedding performance and unveils sex differences not reported so far.","Cappello, Elisa Morgana;Lettieri, Giada;Malizia, Andrea Patricelli;d’Arcangelo, Sonia;Handjaras, Giacomo;Lattanzi, Nicola;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Cecchetti, Luca",57348734100;56680972900;16028897900;57463509700;35748302500;56136055200;8565770200;56625136900
10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2021.108089,1,"Studies in non-human animal models have revealed that in early development, the onset of visual input gates the critical period closure of some auditory functions. The study of rare individuals whose sight was restored after a period of congenital blindness offers the rare opportunity to assess whether early visual input is a prerequisite for the full development of auditory functions in humans as well. Here, we investigated whether a few months of delayed visual onset would affect the development of Auditory Brainstem Responses (ABRs). ABRs are widely used in the clinical practice to assess both functionality and development of the subcortical auditory pathway and, provide reliable data at the individual level. We collected Auditory Brainstem Responses from two case studies, young children (both having less than 5 years of age) who experienced a transient visual deprivation since birth due to congenital bilateral dense cataracts (BC), and who acquired sight at about two months of age. As controls, we tested 41 children (sighted controls, SC) with typical development, as well as two children who were treated (at about two months of age) for congenital monocular cataracts (MC). The SC group data served to predict, at the individual level, wave latencies of each BC and MC participant. Statistics were performed both at the single subject as well as at the group levels on latencies of main ABR waves (I, III, V and SN10). Results revealed delayed response latencies for both BC children compared with the SC group starting from the wave III. Conversely, no difference emerged between MC children and the SC group. These findings suggest that in case the onset of patterned visual input is delayed, the functional development of the subcortical auditory pathway lags behind typical developmental trajectories. Ultimately results are in favor of the presence of a crossmodal sensitive period in the human subcortical auditory system.","Martinelli, A.;Bianchi, B.;Fratini, C.;Handjaras, G.;Fantoni, M.;Trabalzini, F.;Polizzi, S.;Caputo, R.;Bottari, D.",57221355213;57343573100;57343724900;35748302500;57344015900;15519822400;56735996300;7103321735;24365931900
10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118574,0,"Functional Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (fQSM) allows for the quantitative measurement of time-varying magnetic susceptibility across cortical and subcortical brain structures with a potentially higher spatial specificity than conventional fMRI. While the usefulness of fQSM with General Linear Model and “On/Off” paradigms has been assessed, little is known about the potential applications and limitations of this technique in more sophisticated experimental paradigms and analyses, such as those currently used in modern neuroimaging. To thoroughly characterize fQSM activations, here we used 7T MRI, tonotopic mapping, as well as univariate (i.e., GLM and population Receptive Field) and multivariate (Representational Similarity Analysis; RSA) analyses. Although fQSM detected less tone-responsive voxels than fMRI, they were more consistently localized in gray matter. Also, the majority of active gray matter voxels exhibited negative fQSM response, signaling the expected oxyhemoglobin increase, whereas positive fQSM activations were mainly in white matter. Though fMRI- and fQSM-based tonotopic maps were overall comparable, the representation of frequency tunings in tone-sensitive regions was significantly more balanced for fQSM. Lastly, RSA revealed that frequency information from the auditory cortex could be successfully retrieved by using either methods. Overall, fQSM produces complementary results to conventional fMRI, as it captures small-scale variations in the activation pattern which inform multivariate measures. Although positive fQSM responses deserve further investigation, they do not impair the interpretation of contrasts of interest. The quantitative nature of fQSM, its spatial specificity and the possibility to simultaneously acquire canonical fMRI support the use of this technique for longitudinal and multicentric studies and pre-surgical mapping.","Lancione, Marta;Costagli, Mauro;Handjaras, Giacomo;Tosetti, Michela;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Pietrini, Pietro;Cecchetti, Luca",57195628629;22333629800;35748302500;6701756843;8565770200;7005057128;56625136900
10.3390/clockssleep3030035,8,"The study of dreams represents a crucial intersection between philosophical, psychological, neuroscientific, and clinical interests. Importantly, one of the main sources of insight into dreaming activity are the (oral or written) reports provided by dreamers upon awakening from their sleep. Classically, two main types of information are commonly extracted from dream reports: structural and semantic, content-related information. Extracted structural information is typically limited to the simple count of words or sentences in a report. Instead, content analysis usually relies on quantitative scores assigned by two or more (blind) human operators through the use of predefined coding systems. Within this review, we will show that methods borrowed from the field of linguistic analysis, such as graph analysis, dictionary-based content analysis, and distributional semantics approaches, could be used to complement and, in many cases, replace classical measures and scales for the quantitative structural and semantic assessment of dream reports. Importantly, these methods allow the direct (operator-independent) extraction of quantitative information from language data, hence enabling a fully objective and reproducible analysis of conscious experiences occurring during human sleep. Most importantly, these approaches can be partially or fully automatized and may thus be easily applied to the analysis of large datasets.","Elce, Valentina;Handjaras, Giacomo;Bernardi, Giulio",57218649526;35748302500;54988409300
10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118117,7,"EEG slow waves, the hallmarks of NREM sleep are thought to be crucial for the regulation of several important processes, including learning, sensory disconnection and the removal of brain metabolic wastes. Animal research indicates that slow waves may involve complex interactions within and between cortical and subcortical structures. Conventional EEG in humans, however, has a low spatial resolution and is unable to accurately describe changes in the activity of subcortical and deep cortical structures. To overcome these limitations, here we took advantage of simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings to map cortical and subcortical hemodynamic (BOLD) fluctuations time-locked to slow waves of light sleep. Recordings were performed in twenty healthy adults during an afternoon nap. Slow waves were associated with BOLD-signal increases in the posterior brainstem and in portions of thalamus and cerebellum characterized by preferential functional connectivity with limbic and somatomotor areas, respectively. At the cortical level, significant BOLD-signal decreases were instead found in several areas, including insula and somatomotor cortex. Specifically, a slow signal increase preceded slow-wave onset and was followed by a delayed, stronger signal decrease. Similar hemodynamic changes were found to occur at different delays across most cortical brain areas, mirroring the propagation of electrophysiological slow waves, from centro-frontal to inferior temporo-occipital cortices. Finally, we found that the amplitude of electrophysiological slow waves was positively related to the magnitude and inversely related to the delay of cortical and subcortical BOLD-signal changes. These regional patterns of brain activity are consistent with theoretical accounts of the functions of sleep slow waves.","Betta, Monica;Handjaras, Giacomo;Leo, Andrea;Federici, Alessandra;Farinelli, Valentina;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Siclari, Francesca;Meletti, Stefano;Ballotta, Daniela;Benuzzi, Francesca;Bernardi, Giulio",55904308300;35748302500;55311312500;57193834248;36165324000;8565770200;36764231300;6701670785;56539993300;6602925063;54988409300
10.1093/gigascience/giab043,11,"Background: Shedding light on the neuroscientific mechanisms of human upper limb motor control, in both healthy and disease conditions (e.g., after a stroke), can help to devise effective tools for a quantitative evaluation of the impaired conditions, and to properly inform the rehabilitative process. Furthermore, the design and control of mechatronic devices can also benefit from such neuroscientific outcomes, with important implications for assistive and rehabilitation robotics and advanced human-machine interaction. To reach these goals, we believe that an exhaustive data collection on human behavior is a mandatory step. For this reason, we release U-Limb, a large, multi-modal, multi-center data collection on human upper limb movements, with the aim of fostering trans-disciplinary cross-fertilization. Contribution: This collection of signals consists of data from 91 able-bodied and 65 post-stroke participants and is organized at 3 levels: (i) upper limb daily living activities, during which kinematic and physiological signals (electromyography, electro-encephalography, and electrocardiography) were recorded; (ii) force-kinematic behavior during precise manipulation tasks with a haptic device; and (iii) brain activity during hand control using functional magnetic resonance imaging.","Averta, Giuseppe;Barontini, Federica;Catrambone, Vincenzo;Haddadin, Sami;Handjaras, Giacomo;Held, Jeremia P.O.;Hu, Tingli;Jakubowitz, Eike;Kanzler, Christoph M.;Kühn, Johannes;Lambercy, Olivier;Leo, Andrea;Obermeier, Alina;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Schwarz, Anne;Valenza, Gaetano;Bicchi, Antonio;Bianchi, Matteo",57195416332;57209824559;57204679765;23008499000;35748302500;56940165300;57200394047;24376835600;57208485681;57202941222;21933933900;55311312500;57224943520;8565770200;57207035626;35773784200;7004326697;57202798446
10.1111/ejn.14954,14,"In neuroimaging studies, small sample sizes and the resultant reduced statistical power to detect effects that are not large, combined with inadequate analytic choices, concur to produce inflated or false-positive findings. To mitigate these issues, researchers often restrict analyses to specific brain areas, using the region of interest (ROI) approach. Crucially, ROI analysis assumes the a priori justified definition of the target region. Nonetheless, reports often lack details about where in the timeline, ranging from study conception to the data analysis and interpretation of findings, were ROIs selected. Frequently, the rationale for ROI selection is vague or inadequately founded on the existing literature. These shortcomings have important implications for ROI-based studies, augmenting the risk that observed effects are inflated or even false positives. Tools like preregistration and registered reports could address this problem, ensuring the validity of ROI-based studies. The benefits could be enhanced by additional practices such as selection of ROIs using quantitative methods (i.e., meta-analysis) and the sharing of whole-brain unthresholded maps of effect size, as well as of binary ROIs, in publicly accessible repositories.","Gentili, Claudio;Cecchetti, Luca;Handjaras, Giacomo;Lettieri, Giada;Cristea, Ioana A.",13204290200;56625136900;35748302500;56680972900;25642340700
10.1152/jn.00212.2020,4,"Object recognition relies on different transformations of the retinal input, carried out by the visual system, that range from local contrast to object shape and category. While some of those transformations are thought to occur at specific stages of the visual hierarchy, the features they represent are correlated (e.g., object shape and identity) and selectivity for the same feature overlaps in many brain regions. This may be explained either by collinearity across representations or may instead reflect the coding of multiple dimensions by the same cortical population. Moreover, orthogonal and shared components may differently impact distinctive stages of the visual hierarchy. We recorded functional MRI activity while participants passively attended to object images and employed a statistical approach that partitioned orthogonal and shared object representations to reveal their relative impact on brain processing. Orthogonal shape representations (silhouette, curvature, and medial axis) independently explained distinct and overlapping clusters of selectivity in the occitotemporal and parietal cortex. Moreover, we show that the relevance of shared representations linearly increases moving from posterior to anterior regions. These results indicate that the visual cortex encodes shared relations between different features in a topographic fashion and that object shape is encoded along different dimensions, each representing orthogonal features.","Papale, Paolo;Leo, Andrea;Handjaras, Giacomo;Cecchetti, Luca;Pietrini, Pietro;Ricciardi, Emiliano",57190440455;55311312500;35748302500;56625136900;7005057128;8565770200
10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2571-19.2020,19,"The slow waves of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep reflect experience-dependent plasticity and play a direct role in the restorative functions of sleep. Importantly, slow waves behave as traveling waves, and their propagation is assumed to occur through cortico-cortical white matter connections. In this light, the corpus callosum (CC) may represent the main responsible for cross-hemispheric slow-wave propagation. To verify this hypothesis, we performed overnight high-density (hd)- EEG recordings in five patients who underwent total callosotomy due to drug-resistant epilepsy (CPs; two females), in three noncallosotomized neurologic patients (NPs; two females), and in a sample of 24 healthy adult subjects (HSs; 13 females). In all CPs slow waves displayed a significantly reduced probability of cross-hemispheric propagation and a stronger interhemispheric asymmetry. In both CPs and HSs, the incidence of large slow waves within individual NREM epochs tended to differ across hemispheres, with a relative overall predominance of the right over the left hemisphere. The absolute magnitude of this asymmetry was greater in CPs relative to HSs. However, the CC resection had no significant effects on the distribution of slow-wave origin probability across hemispheres. The present results indicate that CC integrity is essential for the crosshemispheric traveling of slow waves in human sleep, which is in line with the assumption of a direct relationship between white matter integrity and slow-wave propagation. Our findings also revealed a residual cross-hemispheric slow-wave propagation that may rely on alternative pathways, including cortico-subcortico-cortical loops. Finally, these data indicate that the lack of the CC does not lead to differences in slow-wave generation across brain hemispheres.","Avvenuti, Giulia;Handjaras, Giacomo;Betta, Monica;Cataldi, Jacinthe;Imperatori, Laura Sophie;Lattanzi, Simona;Riedner, Brady A.;Pietrini, Pietro;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Tononi, Giulio;Siclari, Francesca;Polonara, Gabriele;Fabri, Mara;Silvestrini, Mauro;Bellesi, Michele;Bernardi, Giulio",57188638994;35748302500;55904308300;57204429555;57209394751;55356677100;14323814400;7005057128;8565770200;7006294703;36764231300;6601977298;7005829601;36868778200;7801530324;54988409300
10.1038/s41586-020-2314-9,436,"Data analysis workflows in many scientific domains have become increasingly complex and flexible. Here we assess the effect of this flexibility on the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging by asking 70 independent teams to analyse the same dataset, testing the same 9 ex-ante hypotheses1. The flexibility of analytical approaches is exemplified by the fact that no two teams chose identical workflows to analyse the data. This flexibility resulted in sizeable variation in the results of hypothesis tests, even for teams whose statistical maps were highly correlated at intermediate stages of the analysis pipeline. Variation in reported results was related to several aspects of analysis methodology. Notably, a meta-analytical approach that aggregated information across teams yielded a significant consensus in activated regions. Furthermore, prediction markets of researchers in the field revealed an overestimation of the likelihood of significant findings, even by researchers with direct knowledge of the dataset2–5. Our findings show that analytical flexibility can have substantial effects on scientific conclusions, and identify factors that may be related to variability in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging.

10.1016/j.sleep.2019.12.030,11,"Sudden drops in pulse wave amplitude (PWA) measured by finger photoplethysmography (PPG) are known to reflect peripheral vasoconstriction resulting from sympathetic activation. Previous work demonstrated that sympathetic activations during sleep typically accompany the occurrence of pathological respiratory and motor events, and their alteration may be associated with the arising of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Importantly, PWA-drops often occur in the absence of visually identifiable cortical micro-arousals and may thus represent a more accurate marker of sleep disruption/fragmentation. In this light, an objective and reproducible quantification and characterization of sleep-related PWA-drops may offer a valuable, non-invasive approach for the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of patients with sleep disorders. However, the manual identification of PWA-drops represents a time-consuming practice potentially associated with high intra/inter-scorer variability. Since validated algorithms are not readily available for research and clinical purposes, here we present a novel automated approach to detect and characterize significant drops in the PWA-signal. The algorithm was tested against expert human scorers who visually inspected corresponding PPG-recordings. Results demonstrated that the algorithm reliably detects PWA-drops and is able to characterize them in terms of parameters with a potential physiological and clinical relevance, including timing, amplitude, duration and slopes. The method is completely user-independent, processes all-night PSG-data, automatically dealing with potential artefacts, sensor loss/displacements, and stage-dependent variability in PWA-time-series. Such characteristics make this method a valuable candidate for the comparative investigation of large clinical datasets, to gain a better insight into the reciprocal links between sympathetic activity, sleep-related alterations, and metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.","Betta, M.;Handjaras, G.;Ricciardi, E.;Pietrini, P.;Haba-Rubio, J.;Siclari, F.;Heinzer, R.;Bernardi, G.",55904308300;35748302500;8565770200;7005057128;55948208000;36764231300;55623598100;54988409300

However, which mechanisms link descriptions of affective states to brain activity is unclear, with evidence supporting either local or distributed processing. A biologically favorable alternative is provided by the notion of gradient, which postulates the isomorphism between functional representations of stimulus features and cortical distance. Here, we use fMRI activity evoked by an emotionally charged movie and continuous ratings of the perceived emotion intensity to reveal the topographic organization of affective states. Results show that three orthogonal and spatially overlapping gradients encode the polarity, complexity and intensity of emotional experiences in right temporo-parietal territories. The spatial arrangement of these gradients allows the brain to map a variety of affective states within a single patch of cortex. As this organization resembles how sensory regions represent psychophysical properties (e.g., retinotopy), we propose emotionotopy as a principle of emotion coding.","Lettieri, Giada;Handjaras, Giacomo;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Leo, Andrea;Papale, Paolo;Betta, Monica;Pietrini, Pietro;Cecchetti, Luca",56680972900;35748302500;8565770200;55311312500;57190440455;55904308300;7005057128;56625136900

Relevant features span from simple low-level properties, as contrast and spatial frequencies, to object-based attributes, as shape and category. However, how these features are integrated into coherent percepts is still debated. Moreover, these dimensions often share common biases: for instance, stimuli from the same category (e.g., tools) may have similar shapes. Here, using magnetoencephalography, we revealed the temporal dynamics of feature processing in human subjects attending to objects from six semantic categories. By employing Relative Weights Analysis, we mitigated collinearity between model-based descriptions of stimuli and showed that low-level properties (contrast and spatial frequencies), shape (medial-axis) and category are represented within the same spatial locations early in time: 100–150 ms after stimulus onset. This fast and overlapping processing may result from independent parallel computations, with categorical representation emerging later than the onset of low-level feature processing, yet before shape coding. Categorical information is represented both before and after shape, suggesting a role for this feature in the refinement of categorical matching.","Papale, Paolo;Betta, Monica;Handjaras, Giacomo;Malfatti, Giulia;Cecchetti, Luca;Rampinini, Alessandra;Pietrini, Pietro;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Turella, Luca;Leo, Andrea",57190440455;55904308300;35748302500;57208881629;56625136900;57190443337;7005057128;8565770200;15520235500;55311312500

With modern literature arguing against unique roles for these cortical regions, different theories have favored either neural code-sharing or cortical space-sharing, thus trying to explain the intertwined spatial and functional organization of motor and acoustic components across the fronto-temporal cortical network. In this context, the focus of attention has recently shifted toward specific model fitting, aimed at motor and/or acoustic space reconstruction in brain activity within the language network. Here, we tested a model based on acoustic properties (formants), and one based on motor properties (articulation parameters), where model-free decoding of evoked fMRI activity during perception, imagery, and production of vowels had been successful. Results revealed that phonological information organizes around formant structure during the perception of vowels; interestingly, such a model was reconstructed in a broad temporal region, outside of the primary auditory cortex, but also in the pars triangularis of the left inferior frontal gyrus. Conversely, articulatory features were not associated with brain activity in these regions. Overall, our results call for a degree of interdependence based on acoustic information, between the frontal and temporal ends of the language network.","Rampinini, Alessandra Cecilia;Handjaras, Giacomo;Leo, Andrea;Cecchetti, Luca;Betta, Monica;Marotta, Giovanna;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Pietrini, Pietro",57190443337;35748302500;55311312500;56625136900;55904308300;55951413200;8565770200;7005057128

Findings on the association between vitamin-related biochemistry and cognitive abilities suggest that the structural and functional properties of the brain may represent an intermediate biomarker linking vitamin concentrations to cognition. Despite this, no previous study directly investigated whether vitamin B12, folate, and homocysteine levels are sufficient to explain individual neuropsychological profiles or, alternatively, whether the activity of brain regions modulated by these compounds better predicts cognition in elders. Here, we measured the relationship between vitamin blood concentrations, scores at seventeen neuropsychological tests, and brain activity of sixty-five elders spanning from normal to Mild Cognitive Impairment. We then evaluated whether task-related brain responses represent an intermediate phenotype, providing a better prediction of subjects' neuropsychological scores, as compared to the one obtained considering blood biochemistry only. We found that the hemodynamic activity of the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex was positively associated (p value < 0 05 cluster corrected) with vitamin B12 concentrations, suggesting that elders with higher B12 levels had a more pronounced recruitment of this salience network region. Crucially, the activity of this area significantly predicted subjects' visual search and attention abilities (p value = 0 0023), whereas B12 levels per se failed to do so. Our results demonstrate that the relationship between blood biochemistry and elders' cognitive abilities is revealed when brain activity is included into the equation, thus highlighting the role of brain imaging as intermediate phenotype.","Cecchetti, Luca;Lettieri, Giada;Handjaras, Giacomo;Leo, Andrea;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Pietrini, Pietro;Pellegrini, Silvia;Andreassi, M.

Previous neuroimaging studies have highlighted that voluntary retrieval processes from AM involve different forms of memory and cognitive functions. Thus, a complex and widespread brain functional network has been found to support AM. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study used a multivariate approach to determine whether neural activity within the AM circuit would recognize memories of real autobiographical events, and to evaluate individual differences in the recruitment of this network. Fourteen right-handed females took part in the study. During scanning, subjects were presented with sentences representing a detail of a highly emotional real event (positive or negative) and were asked to indicate whether the sentence described something that had or had not really happened to them. Group analysis showed a set of cortical areas able to discriminate the truthfulness of the recalled events: medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex, precuneus, bilateral angular, superior frontal gyri, and early visual cortical areas. Single-subject results showed that the decoding occurred at different time points. No differences were found between recalling a positive or a negative event. Our results show that the entire AM network is engaged in monitoring the veracity of AMs. This process is not affected by the emotional valence of the experience but rather by individual differences in cognitive strategies used to retrieve AMs.","Benuzzi, Francesca;Ballotta, Daniela;Handjaras, Giacomo;Leo, Andrea;Papale, Paolo;Zucchelli, Michaela;Molinari, Maria Angela;Lui, Fausta;Cecchetti, Luca;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Sartori, Giuseppe;Pietrini, Pietro;Nichelli, Paolo Frigio",6602925063;56539993300;35748302500;55311312500;57190440455;56835384100;17534899400;7003908108;56625136900;8565770200;7007044463;7005057128;7005740633
10.3389/fnhum.2018.00248,56,"Previous work showed that two types of slow waves are temporally dissociated during the transition to sleep: widespread, large and steep slow waves predominate early in the falling asleep period (type I), while smaller, more circumscribed slow waves become more prevalent later (type II). Here, we studied the possible occurrence of these two types of slow waves in stable non-REM (NREM) sleep and explored potential differences in their regulation. A heuristic approach based on slow wave synchronization efficiency was developed and applied to high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings collected during consolidated NREM sleep to identify the potential type I and type II slow waves. Slow waves with characteristics compatible with those previously described for type I and type II were identified in stable NREM sleep. Importantly, these slow waves underwent opposite changes across the night, with only type II slow waves displaying a clear homeostatic regulation. In addition, we showed that the occurrence of type I slow waves was often followed by larger type II slow waves, whereas the occurrence of type II slow waves was usually followed by smaller type I waves. Finally, type II slow waves were associated with a relative increase in spindle activity, while type I slow waves triggered periods of high-frequency activity. Our results provide evidence for the existence of two distinct slow wave synchronization processes that underlie two different types of slow waves.

Data from nonhuman primates show that segmentation leads to two distinct, but associated processes: the enhancement of neural activity during figure processing (i.e., foreground enhancement) and the suppression of background-related activity (i.e., background suppression). To study foreground-background segmentation in ecological conditions, we introduce a novel method based on parametric modulation of low-level image properties followed by application of simple computational image-processing models. By correlating the outcome of this procedure with human fMRI activity, measured during passive viewing of 334 natural images, we produced easily interpretable “correlation images” from visual populations. Results show evidence of foreground enhancement in all tested regions, from V1 to lateral occipital complex (LOC), while background suppression occurs in V4 and LOC only. Correlation images derived from V4 and LOC revealed a preserved spatial resolution of foreground textures, indicating a richer representation of the salient part of natural images, rather than a simplistic model of object shape.

Recent cognitive models ascribed different levels of disembedding task performance to the efficiency of the subtended mental processes engaged during visuo-spatial perception. Here we aimed at assessing whether different levels of the disembedding ability were associated to the functional signatures of neural efficiency, defined as a specific modulation in response magnitude and functional connectivity strength in task-related areas. Consequently, brain activity evoked by a visual task involving the disembedding ability was acquired using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a sample of 23 right-handed healthy individuals. Brain activity was analyzed at different levels of information processing, from local responses to connectivity interactions between brain nodes, as far as to network topological properties. All different levels of information processing were significantly modulated by individual behavioral performance. Specifically, single voxel response magnitude, connectivity strength of the right intrahemispheric and interhemispheric edges, and graph measures (i.e., local and global efficiency) were negatively associated to behavioral performance. Altogether, these results indicate that efficiency during a disembedding task cannot be merely attributed to a reduced neural recruitment of task-specific regions, but can be better characterized as an enhanced functional hemispherical asymmetry.","Danti, Sabrina;Handjaras, Giacomo;Cecchetti, Luca;Beuzeron-Mangina, Helen;Pietrini, Pietro;Ricciardi, Emiliano",56682722100;35748302500;56625136900;35078173400;7005057128;8565770200

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and multivoxel pattern analysis, we showed functional and spatial segregation across the left fronto-temporal cortex during listening, imagery and production of vowels. In accordance with classical models of language and evidence from functional studies, the inferior frontal and superior temporal cortices discriminated among perceived and produced vowels respectively, also engaging in the non-classical, alternative function - i.e. perception in the inferior frontal and production in the superior temporal cortex. Crucially, though, contiguous and non-overlapping sub-regions within these hubs performed either the classical or non-classical function, the latter also representing non-linguistic sounds (i.e., pure tones).

However, the analysis of concepts as individual entities, rather than as items belonging to distinct superordinate categories, may represent a significant advancement in the comprehension of how conceptual knowledge is encoded in the human brain. Here, we studied the individual representation of thirty concrete nouns from six different categories, across different sensory modalities (i.e., auditory and visual) and groups (i.e., sighted and congenitally blind individuals) in a core hub of the semantic network, the left angular gyrus, and in its neighboring regions within the lateral parietal cortex. Four models based on either perceptual or semantic features at different levels of complexity (i.e., low- or high-level) were used to predict fMRI brain activity using representational similarity encoding analysis. When controlling for the superordinate component, high-level models based on semantic and shape information led to significant encoding accuracies in the intraparietal sulcus only. This region is involved in feature binding and combination of concepts across multiple sensory modalities, suggesting its role in high-level representation of conceptual knowledge. Moreover, when the information regarding superordinate categories is retained, a large extent of parietal cortex is engaged. This result indicates the need to control for the coarse-level categorial organization when performing studies on higher-level processes related to the retrieval of semantic information.","Handjaras, Giacomo;Leo, Andrea;Cecchetti, Luca;Papale, Paolo;Lenci, Alessandro;Marotta, Giovanna;Pietrini, Pietro;Ricciardi, Emiliano",35748302500;55311312500;56625136900;57190440455;8286541500;55951413200;7005057128;8565770200

Do these changes continue to accumulate if task training continues, and can they be reverted by sleep? We addressed these questions by combining structural and diffusion weighted MRI and high-density EEG in 16 subjects studied during the physiological sleep/wake cycle, after 12 h and 24 h of intense practice in two different tasks, and after post-training sleep. Compared to baseline wake, 12 h of training led to a decline in cortical mean diffusivity. The decrease became even more significant after 24 h of task practice combined with sleep deprivation. Prolonged practice also resulted in decreased ventricular volume and increased GM and WM subcortical volumes. All changes reverted after recovery sleep. Moreover, these structural alterations predicted cognitive performance at the individual level, suggesting that sleep's ability to counteract performance deficits is linked to its effects on the brain microstructure. The cellular mechanisms that account for the structural effects of sleep are unknown, but they may be linked to its role in promoting the production of cerebrospinal fluid and the decrease in synapse size and strength, as well as to its recently discovered ability to enhance the extracellular space and the clearance of brain metabolites.","Bernardi, Giulio;Cecchetti, Luca;Siclari, Francesca;Buchmann, Andreas;Yu, Xiaoqian;Handjaras, Giacomo;Bellesi, Michele;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Kecskemeti, Steven R.;Riedner, Brady A.;Alexander, Andrew L.;Benca, Ruth M.;Ghilardi, M.

Therefore, in the present multicenter study, we used MRI to measure volume of the superior and inferior colliculi, as well as of the thalamic nuclei relaying sensory and motor information to the neocortex, parcellated according to atlas-based thalamo-cortical connections, in 29 individuals with congenital blindness of peripheral origin (17 M, age 35.7 ± 14.3 years) and 29 sighted subjects (17 M, age 31.9 ± 9.0). Blind participants showed an overall volume reduction in the left (p = 0.008) and right (p = 0.007) thalami, as compared to the sighted individuals. Specifically, the lateral geniculate (i.e., primary visual thalamic relay nucleus) was 40 % reduced (left: p = 4 × 10−6, right: p < 1 × 10−6), consistent with findings from animal studies. In addition, associated thalamic nuclei that project to temporal (left: p = 0.005, right: p = 0.005), prefrontal (left: p = 0.010, right: p = 0.014), occipital (left: p = 0.005, right: p = 0.023), and right premotor (p = 0.024) cortical regions were also significantly reduced in the congenitally blind group. Conversely, volumes of the relay nuclei directly involved in auditory, motor, and somatosensory processing were not affected by visual deprivation. In contrast, no difference in volume was observed in either the superior or the inferior colliculus between the two groups. Our findings indicate that visual loss since birth leads to selective volumetric changes within diencephalic, but not mesencephalic, structures. Both changes in reciprocal cortico-thalamic connections or modifications in the intrinsic connectivity between relay and association nuclei of the thalamus may contribute to explain these alterations in thalamic volumes. Sparing of the superior colliculi is in line with their composite, multisensory projections, and with their not exclusive visual nature.","Cecchetti, Luca;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Handjaras, Giacomo;Kupers, Ron;Ptito, Maurice;Pietrini, Pietro",56625136900;8565770200;35748302500;7003484370;7005537267;7005057128

The concept of synergy has been proposed to indicate functional modules that may simplify the control of hand postures by simultaneously recruiting sets of muscles and joints. However, whether and to what extent synergic hand postures are encoded as such at a cortical level remains unknown. Here, we combined kinematic, electromyography, and brain activity measures obtained by functional magnetic resonance imaging while subjects performed a variety of movements towards virtual objects. Hand postural information, encoded through kinematic synergies, were represented in cortical areas devoted to hand motor control and successfully discriminated individual grasping movements, significantly outperforming alternative somatotopic or muscle-based models. Importantly, hand postural synergies were predicted by neural activation patterns within primary motor cortex. These findings support a novel cortical organization for hand movement control and open potential applications for brain-computer interfaces and neuroprostheses.","Leo, Andrea;Handjaras, Giacomo;Bianchi, Matteo;Marino, Hamal;Gabiccini, Marco;Guidi, Andrea;Scilingo, Enzo Pasquale;Pietrini, Pietro;Bicchi, Antonio;Santello, Marco;Ricciardi, Emiliano",55311312500;35748302500;57202798446;55325588200;7801538627;16315930500;6601971636;7005057128;7004326697;6603708875;8565770200

Previous models proposed the distinct features of a motor act to be hierarchically organized in separated, but functionally interconnected, cortical areas. Here, we hypothesized that distinct patterns across a wide expanse of cortex may actually subserve a topographically organized coding of different categories of actions that represents, at a higher cognitive level and independently from the distinct motor features, the action and its final aim as a whole. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and pattern classification approaches on the neural responses of 14 right-handed individuals passively watching short movies of hand-performed tool-mediated, transitive, and meaningful intransitive actions, we were able to discriminate with a high accuracy and characterize the category-specific response patterns. Actions are distinctively coded in distributed and overlapping neural responses within an action-selective network, comprising frontal, parietal, lateral occipital and ventrotemporal regions.

Over the last few decades, modern neuroscience, and specifically the development of methodologies for the structural and the functional exploration of the brain have made it possible to investigate old questions with an innovative approach. In this brief review, we discuss the main findings from a series of brain anatomical and functional studies conducted in sighted and congenitally blind individuals by our’s and others' laboratories. Historically, research on the ‘blind brain’ has focused mainly on the cross-modal plastic changes that follow sensory deprivation. More recently, a novel line of research has been developed to determine to what extent visual experience is truly required to achieve a representation of the surrounding environment. Overall, the results of these studies indicate that most of the brain fine morphological and functional architecture is programmed to develop and function independently from any visual experience. Distinct cortical areas are able to process information in a supramodal fashion, that is, independently from the sensory modality that carries that information to the brain. These observations strongly support the hypothesis of a modality-independent, i.e. more abstract, cortical organization, and may contribute to explain how congenitally blind individuals may interact efficiently with an external world that they have never seen.","Ricciardi, Emiliano;Handjaras, Giacomo;Pietrini, Pietro",8565770200;35748302500;7005057128

While many studies have investigated brain activity related to driving simulation under distinct conditions, little is known about the brain morphological and functional architecture in professional competitive driving, which requires exceptional motor and navigational skills. Here, 11 professional racing-car drivers and 11 “naïve” volunteers underwent both structural and functional brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Subjects were presented with short movies depicting a Formula One car racing in four different official circuits. Brain activity was assessed in terms of regional response, using an Inter-Subject Correlation (ISC) approach, and regional interactions by mean of functional connectivity. In addition, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to identify specific structural differences between the two groups and potential interactions with functional differences detected by the ISC analysis. Relative to non-experienced drivers, professional drivers showed a more consistent recruitment of motor control and spatial navigation devoted areas, including premotor/motor cortex, striatum, anterior, and posterior cingulate cortex and retrosplenial cortex, precuneus, middle temporal cortex, and parahippocampus. Moreover, some of these brain regions, including the retrosplenial cortex, also had an increased gray matter density in professional car drivers. Furthermore, the retrosplenial cortex, which has been previously associated with the storage of observer-independent spatial maps, revealed a specific correlation with the individual driver's success in official competitions. These findings indicate that the brain functional and structural organization in highly trained racing-car drivers differs from that of subjects with an ordinary driving experience, suggesting that specific anatomo-functional changes may subtend the attainment of exceptional driving performance.","Bernardi, Giulio;Cecchetti, Luca;Handjaras, Giacomo;Sani, Lorenzo;Gaglianese, Anna;Ceccarelli, Riccardo;Franzoni, Ferdinando;Galetta, Fabio;Santoro, Gino;Goebel, Rainer;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Pietrini, Pietro",54988409300;56625136900;35748302500;21735510400;54986210200;55887744900;6701315185;7006410177;7201778481;7102516398;8565770200;7005057128

10.1177/1535370213497326,8,"Potentiation of cholinergic transmission influences stimulus processing by enhancing signal detection through suppression and/or filtering out of irrelevant information (bottom-up modulation) and with top-down task-oriented executive mechanisms based on the recruitment of prefrontal and parietal attentional systems. The cholinergic system also plays a critical role in working memory (WM) processes and preferentially modulates WM encoding, likely through stimulus-processing mechanisms. Previous research reported increased brain responses in visual extrastriate cortical regions during cholinergic enhancement in the encoding phase of WM, independently addressing object and spatial encoding. The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine the effects of cholinergic enhancement on encoding of key visual processing features. Subjects participated in two scanning sessions, one during an intravenous (i.v.) infusion of saline and the other during an infusion of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine. In each scan session, subjects alternated between a face identity recognition and a spatial location WM. Enhanced cholinergic function increased neural activity in the ventral stream during encoding of face identity and in the dorsal stream during encoding of face location. Conversely, a reduction in brain response was found for scrambled sensorimotor control images. The cholinergic effects on neural activity in the ventral stream during encoding of face identity were stronger than those observed in the dorsal stream during encoding of face location, likely as a consequence of the role of acetylcholine in establishing the inherently relevant nature of face identity. Despite the limited sample-size, the results suggest the stimulus-dependent role of cholinergic system in signal detection, as they show that cholinergic potentiation enhances neural activity in regions associated with early perceptual processing in a selective manner depending on the attended stimulus feature. © 2013 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.","Handjaras, Giacomo;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Szczepanik, Joanna;Pietrini, Pietro;Furey, Maura L.",35748302500;8565770200;8778635000;7005057128;7004873460

However, it is yet unclear how the peripersonal space is encoded and remapped depending on the availability of visual feedback and on the target position within the individual's reachable space, and which cerebral areas subserve such processes. Here, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine neural activity while healthy young participants performed reach-to-grasp movements with and without visual feedback and at different distances of the target from the effector (near to the hand-about 15 cm from the starting position-vs. far from the hand-about 30 cm from the starting position). Brain response in the superior parietal lobule bilaterally, in the right dorsal premotor cortex, and in the anterior part of the right inferior parietal lobule was significantly greater during visually-guided grasping of targets located at the far distance compared to grasping of targets located near to the hand. In the absence of visual feedback, the inferior parietal lobule exhibited a greater activity during grasping of targets at the near compared to the far distance. Results suggest that in the presence of visual feedback, a visuo-motor circuit integrates visuo-motor information when targets are located farther away.

Furthermore, recent findings indicate that the action-observation network encodes not merely the observed motor act, but rather a representation that is independent from a specific sensory modality or sensory experience. In the present study, we wished to determine to what extent this distributed and 'more abstract' representation of action is truly supramodal, i.e. shares a common coding across sensory modalities. To this aim, a pattern recognition approach was employed to analyze neural responses in sighted and congenitally blind subjects during visual and/or auditory presentation of hand-made actions. Multivoxel pattern analyses-based classifiers discriminated action from non-action stimuli across sensory conditions (visual and auditory) and experimental groups (blind and sighted). Moreover, these classifiers labeled as 'action' the pattern of neural responses evoked during actual motor execution. Interestingly, discriminative information for the action/non action classification was located in a bilateral, but left-prevalent, network that strongly overlaps with brain regions known to form the action-observation network and the human mirror system. The ability to identify action features with a multivoxel pattern analyses-based classifier in both sighted and blind individuals and independently from the sensory modality conveying the stimuli clearly supports the hypothesis of a supramodal, distributed functional representation of actions, mainly within the action-observation network. © 2013 Ricciardi et al.","Ricciardi, Emiliano;Handjaras, Giacomo;Bonino, Daniela;Vecchi, Tomaso;Fadiga, Luciano;Pietrini, Pietro",8565770200;35748302500;24376198000;6603719753;6603680863;7005057128

We have hypothesized that the changes in neural activity observed during increased cholinergic function reflect an increase in neural efficiency that leads to improved task performance. The current study tested this hypothesis by assessing neural efficiency based on cholinergically-mediated effects on regional brain connectivity and BOLD signal variability. Nine subjects participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover fMRI study. Following an infusion of physostigmine (1 mg/h) or placebo, echo-planar imaging (EPI) was conducted as participants performed a selective attention task. During the task, two images comprised of superimposed pictures of faces and houses were presented. Subjects were instructed periodically to shift their attention from one stimulus component to the other and to perform a matching task using hand held response buttons. A control condition included phase-scrambled images of superimposed faces and houses that were presented in the same temporal and spatial manner as the attention task; participants were instructed to perform a matching task. Cholinergic enhancement improved performance during the selective attention task, with no change during the control task. Functional connectivity analyses showed that the strength of connectivity between ventral visual processing areas and task-related occipital, parietal and prefrontal regions reduced significantly during cholinergic enhancement, exclusively during the selective attention task. Physostigmine administration also reduced BOLD signal temporal variability relative to placebo throughout temporal and occipital visual processing areas, again during the selective attention task only. Together with the observed behavioral improvement, the decreases in connectivity strength throughout task-relevant regions and BOLD variability within stimulus processing regions support the hypothesis that cholinergic augmentation results in enhanced neural efficiency.

10.1155/2012/720278,41,"Previous studies in early blind individuals posited a possible role of parieto-occipital connections in conveying nonvisual information to the visual occipital cortex. As a consequence of blindness, parietal areas would thus become able to integrate a greater amount of multimodal information than in sighted individuals. To verify this hypothesis, we compared fMRI-measured BOLD signal temporal variability, an index of efficiency in functional information integration, in congenitally blind and sighted individuals during tactile spatial discrimination and motion perception tasks. In both tasks, the BOLD variability analysis revealed many cortical regions with a significantly greater variability in the blind as compared to sighted individuals, with an overlapping cluster located in the left inferior parietal/anterior intraparietal cortex. A functional connectivity analysis using this region as seed showed stronger correlations in both tasks with occipital areas in the blind as compared to sighted individuals. As BOLD variability reflects neural integration and processing efficiency, these cross-modal plastic changes in the parietal cortex, even if described in a limited sample, reinforce the hypothesis that this region may play an important role in processing nonvisual information in blind subjects and act as a hub in the cortico-cortical pathway from somatosensory cortex to the reorganized occipital areas.

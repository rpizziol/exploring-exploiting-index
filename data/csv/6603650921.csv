10.1038/s41598-023-31536-5,3,"Eye movement data has been extensively utilized by researchers interested in studying decision-making within the strategic setting of economic games. In this paper, we demonstrate that both deep learning and support vector machine classification methods are able to accurately identify participants’ decision strategies before they commit to action while playing games. Our approach focuses on creating scanpath images that best capture the dynamics of a participant’s gaze behaviour in a way that is meaningful for predictions to the machine learning models. Our results demonstrate a higher classification accuracy by 18% points compared to a baseline logistic regression model, which is traditionally used to analyse gaze data recorded during economic games. In a broader context, we aim to illustrate the potential for eye-tracking data to create information asymmetries in strategic environments in favour of those who collect and process the data. These information asymmetries could become especially relevant as eye-tracking is expected to become more widespread in user applications, with the seemingly imminent mass adoption of virtual reality systems and the development of devices with the ability to record eye movement outside of a laboratory setting.","Byrne, Sean Anthony;Reynolds, Adam Peter Frederick;Biliotti, Carolina;Bargagli-Stoffi, Falco J.;Polonio, Luca;Riccaboni, Massimo",57959034600;57958604000;57958820200;57207772321;56529761100;6603650921
10.1007/s40797-022-00200-8,2,"Technological progress has been recently associated with a crowding-out of cognitive-skill intensive jobs in favour of jobs requiring soft skills, such as ones related to social intelligence, flexibility and creativity. The nature of soft skills makes them hardly replaceable by machine work and among subsets of soft skills, creativity is one of the hardest to define and codify. Therefore, creativity-intensive occupations have been shielded from automation. Given this framework, our study contributes to a nascent field on interdisciplinary research to predict the impact of artificial intelligence on work activities and future jobs using machine learning. In our work, we focus on creativity, starting from its possible definitions, then we get significant insights on creativity patterns and dynamics in the Italian labour market, using a machine learning approach. We make use of the INAPP-ISTAT Survey on Occupations (ICP), where we identify 25 skills associated with creativity. Then, we apply matrix completion—a machine learning technique which is often used by recommender systems—to predict the average importance levels of various creative skills for each profession, showing its excellent prediction capability for the specific problem. We also find that matrix completion typically underestimates the average importance levels of soft skills associated with creativity, especially in the case of professions belonging to the major group of legislators, senior officials and managers, as well as intellectual professionals. Conversely, overestimates are typically obtained for other professions, which may be associated with a higher risk of being automated.","Gnecco, Giorgio;Landi, Sara;Riccaboni, Massimo",22953696000;57786507100;6603650921
10.1111/twec.13457,0,"Economic complexity and machine learning have recently become popular approaches for analysing international trade. However, for effective use of machine learning in relation to economic complexity and policymaking, it is important to understand what are the key features for predictions. In this framework, this article addresses the issue of the interpretability of results obtained with a machine learning technique—namely, matrix completion—when applied to economic complexity, specifically in predicting revealed comparative advantages (RCAs) of countries in different product categories. Shapley values are used to measure the role each country plays in predicting the RCAs of other countries. Countries relevant for prediction may differ from countries whose RCA values are similar to those of the country of interest when a standard similarity measure such as cosine similarity is used. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach to identifying comparable countries by focussing our analysis on export diversification into complex goods of selected European countries.","Gnecco, Giorgio;Nutarelli, Federico;Riccaboni, Massimo",22953696000;57211477171;6603650921
10.1016/j.econmod.2023.106374,0,"After decades of trade liberalization, a return to protectionism has been observed in some developed economies. Recent studies have examined the impact of protectionism on international networks. In contrast to these studies, which focus on the impact of import tariffs on the global economy, we develop a production network model with international trade to assess the repercussions of sector-specific import tariffs on the policy-imposing country. Our model shows how the direct impact of higher tariffs on imported intermediate goods is amplified through the domestic production network. We find that the resulting decline in GDP and consumer welfare depends on the affected industries: their network centrality, the elasticity of substitution between foreign and domestic varieties, and the ratio of net-of-tax prices of domestic and foreign varieties. Our work contributes to the current debate on tariff escalation by advancing the literature on the effective rate of protection in a networked economy.","Kreuter, Helena;Riccaboni, Massimo",57221255837;6603650921

In the context of I/O analysis, the methodology adopted by national statistical offices in data collection raises the issue of obtaining reliable data in a timely fashion and it makes the reconstruction of (parts of) the I/O matrices of particular interest. In this work, we propose a method combining hierarchical clustering and matrix completion with a LASSO-like nuclear norm penalty, to predict missing entries of a partially unknown I/O matrix. Through analyses based on both real-world and synthetic I/O matrices, we study the effectiveness of the proposed method to predict missing values from both previous years data and current data related to countries similar to the one for which current data are obscured. To show the usefulness of our method, an application based on World Input–Output Database (WIOD) tables—which are an example of industry-by-industry I/O tables—is provided. Strong similarities in structure between WIOD and other I/O tables are also found, which make the proposed approach easily generalizable to them.","Metulini, Rodolfo;Gnecco, Giorgio;Biancalani, Francesco;Riccaboni, Massimo",56038504800;22953696000;57208628829;6603650921

Using establishment-level data from Madrid City Council and consumer-facing information from this short-term rental company, we find that Airbnb reshapes the urban space by encouraging tourist-oriented businesses, defined as businesses where tourists spend more than locals, at the expense of businesses primarily oriented to locals. These findings prove that short-term rentals do displace not only the local population but also resident-oriented businesses. Ultimately, our findings remain solid regardless of how we measure short-term rental activity and are not influenced by the growth of e-commerce or gentrification.","Hidalgo, Alberto;Riccaboni, Massimo;Velazquez, Francisco J.",57226409764;6603650921;7004217577
10.1007/s11590-023-02052-2,0,"In the recent past, annual CO 2 emissions at the international level were examined from various perspectives, motivated by rising concerns about pollution and climate change. Nevertheless, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the problem of dealing with the potential inaccuracy/missingness of such data at the country and economic sector levels has been overlooked. Thereby, in this article we apply a supervised machine learning technique called Matrix Completion (MC) to predict, for each country in the available database, annual CO 2 emissions data at the sector level, based on past data related to all the sectors, and more recent data related to a subset of sectors. The core idea of MC consists in the formulation of a suitable optimization problem, namely the minimization of a proper trade-off between the approximation error over a set of observed elements of a matrix (training set) and a proxy of the rank of the reconstructed matrix, e.g., its nuclear norm. In the article, we apply MC to the imputation of (artificially) missing elements of country-specific matrices whose elements come from annual CO 2 emission levels related to different sectors, after proper pre-processing at the sector level. Results highlight typically a better performance of the combination of MC with suitably-constructed baseline estimates with respect to the baselines alone. Potential applications of our analysis arise in the prediction of currently missing elements of matrices of annual CO 2 emission levels and in the construction of counterfactuals, useful to estimate the effects of policy changes able to influence the annual CO 2 emission levels of specific sectors in selected countries.","Biancalani, Francesco;Gnecco, Giorgio;Metulini, Rodolfo;Riccaboni, Massimo",57208628829;22953696000;56038504800;6603650921

This paper explicitly accounts for regional capabilities as workforce skills to build skill relatedness and skill complexity measures, that is, the skill-spaces, for 107 Italian regions for the period 2013–19. The data-driven techniques we use reveal that skill-spaces form two highly polarised clusters into social–cognitive and technical–physical skills. We find evidence that social–cognitive skills yield the highest probabilities of regional competitive advantage. A comparison with co-location-based measures shows that our measures are able to capture a substantial part of regional capabilities that cannot be measured with previous measures.","Buyukyazici, Duygu;Mazzoni, Leonardo;Riccaboni, Massimo;Serti, Francesco",57747058600;57211975877;6603650921;26022647900
10.1007/s11135-023-01659-y,1,"Social soft skills are crucial for workers to perform their tasks, yet it is hard to train people on them and to readapt their skill set when needed. In the present work, we analyze the possible effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on social soft skills in the context of Italian occupations related to 88 economic sectors and 14 age groups. We leverage detailed information coming from ICP (i.e. the Italian equivalent of O*Net), provided by the Italian National Institute for the Analysis of Public Policy, from the microdata for research on the continuous detection of labor force, provided by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT), and from ISTAT data on the Italian population. Based on these data, we simulate the impact of COVID-19 on workplace characteristics and working styles that were more severely affected by the lockdown measures and the sanitary dispositions during the pandemic (e.g. physical proximity, face-to-face discussions, working remotely). We then apply matrix completion—a machine-learning technique often used in the context of recommender systems—to predict the average variation in the social soft skills importance levels required for each occupation when working conditions change, as some changes might be persistent in the near future. Professions, sectors, and age groups showing negative average variations are exposed to a deficit in their social soft-skills endowment, which might ultimately lead to lower productivity.","Gnecco, Giorgio;Landi, Sara;Riccaboni, Massimo",22953696000;57786507100;6603650921

10.1038/s41598-022-13206-0,7,"This work applies Matrix Completion (MC) – a class of machine-learning methods commonly used in recommendation systems – to analyze economic complexity. In this paper MC is applied to reconstruct the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) matrix, whose elements express the relative advantage of countries in given classes of products, as evidenced by yearly trade flows. A high-accuracy binary classifier is derived from the MC application to discriminate between elements of the RCA matrix that are, respectively, higher/lower than one. We introduce a novel Matrix cOmpletion iNdex of Economic complexitY (MONEY) based on MC and related to the degree of predictability of the RCA entries of different countries (the lower the predictability, the higher the complexity). Differently from previously-developed economic complexity indices, MONEY takes into account several singular vectors of the matrix reconstructed by MC. In contrast, other indices are based only on one/two eigenvectors of a suitable symmetric matrix derived from the RCA matrix. Finally, MC is compared with state-of-the-art economic complexity indices, showing that the MC-based classifier achieves better performance than previous methods based on the application of machine learning to economic complexity.","Gnecco, Giorgio;Nutarelli, Federico;Riccaboni, Massimo",22953696000;57211477171;6603650921

Moreover, it is shown that the adoption of a price-volume agreement scheme for the first manufacturer can benefit the buyer with respect to the case in which single-price contracts are proposed to the former.

10.3389/fpsyt.2022.826277,2,"Introduction: Several countries imposed nationwide or partial lockdowns to limit the spread of COVID-19 and avoid overwhelming hospitals and intensive care units. Lockdown may involve restriction of movement, stay-at-home orders and self-isolation, which may have dramatic consequences on mental health. Recent studies demonstrated that the negative impact of lockdown restrictions depends on a wide range of psychological and socio-demographic factors. Aims: This longitudinal study aimed to understand how internal factors such as personality and mindfulness traits, and external factors, such as daily habits and house features, affect anxiety, depression and general wellbeing indicators, as well as cognitive functions, during the course of a lockdown. Methods: To address these questions, 96 participants in Italy and the United Kingdom filled out a survey, once a week for 4 weeks, during the first-wave lockdowns. The survey included questions related to their habits and features of the house, as well as validated questionnaires to measure personality traits, mindful attitude and post-traumatic symptoms. Indicators of wellbeing were the affective state, anxiety, stress and psychopathological indices. We also measured the emotional impact of the pandemic on cognitive ability by using two online behavioral tasks [emotional Stroop task (EST) and visual search]. Results: We found that internal factors influenced participants’ wellbeing during the first week of the study, while external factors affected participants in the last weeks. In the first week, internal variables such as openness, conscientiousness and being non-judgmental toward one’s own thoughts and emotions were positively associated with wellbeing; instead, neuroticism and the tendency to observe and describe one’s own thoughts and emotions had detrimental effects on wellbeing. Toward the end of the study, external variables such as watching television and movies, browsing the internet, walking the dog, and having a balcony showed a protective value, while social networking and engaging in video calls predicted lower values of wellbeing. We did not find any effects of wellbeing on cognitive functioning. Conclusion: Recognizing specific traits and habits affecting individuals’ wellbeing (in both short and long terms) during social isolation is crucial to identify people at risk of developing psychological distress and help refine current guidelines to alleviate the psychological consequences of prolonged lockdowns.","Zaninotto, Francesca;Bossi, Francesco;Terry, Philip;Riccaboni, Massimo;Galli, Giulia",57201450674;56963595100;10244763900;6603650921;56817076900
10.1016/j.healthpol.2022.03.013,3,"With pharmaceutical health policy striving for fair and sustainable pricing under increasing budgetary pressures, public stakeholders are more and more willing to be involved in transparent access decision-making related to novel medicines, considered by them to be a societal good. Full net price transparency (NPT) is believed by many to promote price competition and to increase equity by making pharmaceutical products accessible to all. Using agent-based simulations, we find that a full NPT system implemented across EU countries would not be viable. This while, acting as rational economic agents, a group of middle- and lower-income countries would not be willing to give up their confidential agreements with the pharmaceutical industry. Even partial NPT would delay access predominantly in middle- to lower-income countries. Hence, we conclude that implementing net price transparency across Europe would be challenging to reach from a political perspective. Especially in lower-income countries there would remain a plea to be left free to negotiate confidential discounts with drug manufacturers. This while, counterintuitively, in those countries NPT will be seen to be unjust while violating Ramsey pricing and distributive justice principles.","Riccaboni, Massimo;Swoboda, Torben;Van Dyck, Walter",6603650921;57203714867;57191987786

Researchers can promptly keep abreast of others’ scientific production and, in principle, can select new collaborators and build new research teams. A critical factor one should consider when contemplating new potential collaborations is the possibility of unambiguously defining the expertise of other researchers. While some organisations have established database systems to enable their members to manually produce a profile, maintaining such systems is time-consuming and costly. Therefore, there has been a growing interest in retrieving expertise through automated approaches. Indeed, the identification of researchers’ expertise is of great value in many applications, such as identifying qualified experts to supervise new researchers, assigning manuscripts to reviewers, and forming a qualified team. Here, we propose a network-based approach to the construction of authors’ expertise profiles.

10.1016/j.technovation.2021.102405,1,"This paper starts by observing that many licensing contracts contain explicit organizational arrangements for transferring the licensed technology, involving repeated and close interaction between the licensing partners. We argue that these interactions provide opportunities for the licensor to learn from the licensee. Using data on 1861 licensing deals of 254 pharmaceutical and biotech firms between 1995 and 2015, we show that licensors are more likely to cite the inventions from their licensing partner after an out-licensing deal than matched control firm-pairs that do not engage in licensing. The paper makes the following contributions: first, it demonstrates that not only licensees but also licensors can learn from licensing and that this reverse learning stems from the licensor-licensee relation. Second, it shows that firms can learn from directed outward knowledge transfers rather than non-deliberate knowledge spill-outs. Third, we show that the licensor's post-licensing behavior vis-à-vis the licensee reflects targeted learning by tapping into the most valuable components of the licensee's technology portfolio and those new to the licensor. Finally, the paper extends the theoretical framework behind strategic out-licensing decisions. We show that learning from out-licensing is an additional (positive) element in the trade-off faced by licensors in addition to short-term revenue generation and the risk of long-term rent dissipation.","Kelchtermans, Stijn;Leten, Bart;Rabijns, Maarten;Riccaboni, Massimo",24401407300;22734924900;57210274525;6603650921

We estimate product-specific success probabilities using various machine learning methods. The portfolio importance is measured by product and date-specific net present values. We find that market reactions increase in the portfolio importance of the product under development and diminish in its success probability.

Analysis of close to 13,000 research collaborations with foreign universities by the world’s major biopharmaceutical firms (1995–2015) confirms that collaboration at distance occurs if this allows the firm to benefit from scale and knowledge diversity advantages, if the central unit has strong basic research capabilities, and if collaboration is in a core research domain of the MNC while rival firms are locally present. Maturity of the focal research domain is associated with local collaboration. Our findings qualify the common arguments in favor of collaboration in proximity and suggest that (distant) central R&D units are important orchestrators of research collaboration with universities around the globe.","Belderbos, René;Grabowska, Marcelina;Kelchtermans, Stijn;Leten, Bart;Jacob, Jojo;Riccaboni, Massimo",6701791787;57194799243;24401407300;22734924900;55429501200;6603650921

The analysis is grounded on legal and economic considerations of possible interactions between vehicles with different levels of automation, and shows how the existing framework delays innovation. A Risk-Management Approach, identifying one sole responsible party ex ante (one-stop-shop), liable under all circumstances—pursuant to a strict, if not absolute liability rule—is to be preferred. We analyse the solution adopted by some Member States in light of those considerations and conclude that none truly corresponds to a RMA approach, and differences will also cause market fragmentation.

The method is based on the mean-field approximation of the moments associated with the three subgraphs defining the model, namely: the mean numbers of edges, 2-stars, and triangles. A modified gradient ascent method is applied to maximize the log-likelihood function of the p-star model, in which the components of the gradient are computed using approximate values of the moments. Compared to other existing iterative methods for parameter estimation, which are computationally very expensive when the number of vertices becomes large, such as gradient ascent applied to maximum log-likelihood and maximum log-pseudo-likelihood estimation, the proposed approach has the advantage of a much cheaper cost per iteration, which is practically independent of the number of vertices.","Lenarda, Pietro;Gnecco, Giorgio;Riccaboni, Massimo",57189370852;22953696000;6603650921

We find that most of the hESC research is carried out in supportive states, and significant legislative changes have had a minor but noticeable effect on relocation choices.

Crucially, the model assumes two independent mechanisms to drive the extensive and the intensive margins of a firm's export. The resulting lack of (built-in) correlation between the two margins is well reflected in the data and represents the main contribution of our theoretical framework. The model is consistent with several other empirical regularities that characterize multi-product firms, such as the heavy tail in the distribution of the number of products exported by each firm, the strict hierarchy in the sales of products across markets, the substantial degree of product churning and the highly skewed distributions of export sales.","Montinari, Letizia;Riccaboni, Massimo;Schiavo, Stefano",48361481800;6603650921;23100915500

We show that a large diversification gain is achieved through rebalancing but, noteworthy, that makes the network vulnerable in front of unselective shocks.

We find that the popularity of Scratchers’ projects is significantly influenced by the production popularity of their peers. Testing for heterogeneity in influence, we find that Scratchers are not influenced by specific peers who might have highly popular projects, instead it seems that they are influenced by just the aggregate popularity of all peers. We find that Scratchers who have a minimum activity of one month on the platform are more susceptible to peer influence. Scratchers with high tendency to create projects by rebuilding on existing projects on the platform tend to have significant improvements in their future production popularity (due to influence from peers’ production popularity) only in the short term and not in the long run. We also disentangle a self decision making mechanism from other mechanisms that might explain the channel of influence: we find that a significant proportion of the estimated influence from peers is mediated via Scratchers’ decision to create new projects. This highlights Scratchers’ subsequent behavioural decisions in response to existing popularity of peers’ projects. We find evidence of polarized consumption patterns on the platform, i.e., there are certain groups of projects (discovered in an unsupervised manner based on co-consumption patterns) for which Scratchers have high specificity. We do not make claims about how such groups form on the platform - for example, whether it is a conscious choice or is a result of the way the platform is organized.

First, at a given time, we create experimental and control groups such that the peers’ behaviour under investigation can be justified as a random assignment. To do so we exactly match Scratchers’ personal and network attributes in both groups such that Scratchers in the experimental group have peers with higher degree of the behaviour under study compared to the control group, and all other attributes of Scratchers are balanced across both groups.

Using data covering all countries between 1970 and 2000, we find a significant indirect effect of migration on trade, that depends on the chosen weight matrix.","Metulini, Rodolfo;Sgrignoli, Paolo;Schiavo, Stefano;Riccaboni, Massimo",56038504800;36502749700;23100915500;6603650921

In this paper, we discuss this methodological approach and conclude that further work is needed to identify stable and reliable measures of fitness and complexity. We provide theoretical and numerical evidence for the intrinsic instability in the nonlinear definition of the FC algorithm. We perform an in-depth evaluation of the algorithm's rankings in two real world networks at the country level: the global trade network, and the patent network in different technological domains. In both networks, we find evidence of the instabilities predicted theoretically, and show that 'complex' products or patents tend often to be those that countries rarely produce, rather than those that are intrinsically more difficult to produce.","Morrison, Greg;Buldyrev, Sergey V.;Imbruno, Michele;Doria Arrieta, Omar Alonso;Rungi, Armando;Riccaboni, Massimo;Pammolli, Fabio",22835765700;35396328400;57163758400;57196478780;56400879400;6603650921;6603423982

In this paper, we investigate the effects of FDI on trade from a network perspective, since FDI takes not only direct but also indirect channels from origin to destination countries because of firms’ incentive to reduce tax burden, to minimise coordination costs and to break barriers to market entry. We use a unique data set of international corporate control as a measure of stock FDI to construct a corporate control network (CCN), where the nodes are the countries and the edges are the corporate control relationships. Network measures, as the shortest path length and the communicability, are then computed on the CCN to capture the indirect channel of FDI. Empirically, we find that corporate control has a positive effect on trade both directly and indirectly. The result is robust with different specifications and estimation strategies. Hence, our paper provides strong empirical evidence of the indirect effects of FDI on trade. Moreover, we identify a number of interplaying factors such as regional trade agreements and the region of Asia. We also find that the indirect effects are more pronounced for the manufacturing sector than for primary sectors such as oil extraction and agriculture.","Metulini, Rodolfo;Riccaboni, Massimo;Sgrignoli, Paolo;Zhu, Zhen",56038504800;6603650921;36502749700;56643462200

Second, by discriminating across firms based on the number of products sold and markets served, we find that, within the class of multi-product companies active in multiple markets, the distribution converges to a Zipf's law.

We show here that such belief is over-simplistic. We reframe the problem by considering the international food trade and the corresponding virtual water fluxes, which quantify the water used for the production of traded agricultural commodities. By means of robust analytical tools, we show that migrants strengthen the commercial links between countries, triggering trade fluxes caused by food consumption habits persisting after migration. Thus migrants significantly increase the virtual water fluxes and the use of water in the countries of origin. The flux ascribable to each migrant, i.e. the “water suitcase”, is found to have increased from 321 m3/y in 1990 to 1367 m3/y in 2010.

To estimate the strength of the reputation effect, we perform a longitudinal analysis on the careers of 450 highly cited scientists, using the total citations Ci of each scientist as his/her reputation measure. We find a citation crossover cx, which distinguishes the strength of the reputation effect. For publications with c < cx, the author's reputation is found to dominate the annual citation rate. Hence, a new publication may gain a significant early advantage corresponding to roughly a 66% increase in the citation rate for each tenfold increase in Ci. However, the reputation effect becomes negligible for highly cited publications meaning that, for c ≥ cx, the citation rate measures scientific impact more transparently.

In this study we introduce an outreach index to quantify the impact of borders on the community structure and apply it to the case of the European and US patent co-inventors networks. We find that (a) the US connectivity decays as a power of distance, whereas we observe a faster exponential decay for Europe; (b) European network communities essentially correspond to nations and contiguous regions while US communities span multiple states across the whole country without any characteristic geographic scale.

We study the annual production n i(t) of a given scientist i by analyzing longitudinal career data for 200 leading scientists and 100 assistant professors from the physics community. Our empirical analysis of individual productivity dynamics shows that (i) there are increasing returns for the top individuals within the competitive cohort, and that (ii) the distribution of production growth is a leptokurtic ""tent-shaped"" distribution that is remarkably symmetric. Our methodology is general, and we speculate that similar features appear in other disciplines where academic publication is essential and collaboration is a key feature. We introduce a model of proportional growth which reproduces these two observations, and additionally accounts for the significantly right-skewed distributions of career longevity and achievement in science. Using this theoretical model, we show that short-term contracts can amplify the effects of competition and uncertainty making careers more vulnerable to early termination, not necessarily due to lack of individual talent and persistence, but because of random negative production shocks.

Industrial leaders, i.e., the largest companies in terms of market value, are in the highest k -shells of both networks. The nucleus of the life sciences sector is very stable: once a firm enters the nucleus, it is likely to stay there for a long time.

We also conduct a systematic study of these three components in random scale-free networks. Our results suggest that the sizes of the nucleus and the tendrils in scale-free networks decrease as the exponent of the power-law degree distribution λ increases, and disappear for λ3.

10.1016/j.healthpol.2005.01.016,13,"Objective: To describe the changes in costs of care for HIV-positive patients in Italy after the spread of antiretroviral combination therapies (HAART). Methods: Five thousand four hundred and twenty-two patients from the I.CO.N.A. (Italian Cohort Naive Antiretrovirals) study were followed between 1997 and 2002. Costs included antiretroviral therapies (ART), hospital admissions, prophylaxis, and main laboratory examinations. The perspective was that of the National Health Service. Results: Admission costs per person-year decreased from 2148 euro in 1997 to 256 in 2002, while the average annual costs of ART increased from 2145 to 3149 euro (1997 prices). From 1997 to1999, ART costs increased from 42.3 to 85.9% of the total, while admission costs decreased from 42.3 to 7.0% and prophylaxis from 7.3 to 1.7%. The breakdown of ART costs shows how dual therapies decreased over time in favor of HAART, falling from 26.8% in 1997 to 5.9% in 2002. Patients with fewer than five treatment switches had the lowest costs distributions over the entire observation period. Conclusions: From 1997 to 2002 inpatient costs progressively decreased in favor of antiretroviral therapy. Annual average costs per patient decreased, while total direct costs increased over time: health resources, initially concentrated on hospitalized patients were then distributed over a growing number of subjects.","Merito, Monica;Bonaccorsi, Andrea;Pammolli, Fabio;Riccaboni, Massimo;Baio, Gianluca;Arici, Claudio;D'Arminio Monforte, Antonella;Pezzotti, Patrizio;Corsini, Dario;Tramarin, Andrea;Cauda, Roberto;Colangeli, Vincenzo;Pastore, Giuseppe;Montroni, M.;Scalise, G.;Braschi, M.

,49,"This paper investigates patterns of industrial dynamics and competition in the pharmaceutical industry, with particular reference to the consequences of patent expiry in different countries. We focus on the competition at the level of single chemical entities, distinguishing between original brands and generic products. Quarterly data, spanning from July 1987 to December 1998, on sales of pharmaceutical products in four countries (USA, UK, Germany, and France) constitute the basis of our analysis. All the products containing major molecules whose patent expiration date lies between 1986 and 1996 are included in our sample. We show how diffusion of generics is linked to the characteristics of the market and investigate how price dynamics of original products are affected by generic competition. Our empirical investigation shows that the dynamics of drug prices and the competition by generic drugs vary significantly across countries. This heterogeneity notwithstanding, a clear distinction seems to emerge. On the one hand, systems that rely on market-based competition in pharmaceuticals promote a clear distinction between firms that act as innovators and firms that act as imitators after patent expiry. Here, original products enjoy premium prices and exclusivity profits under patent protection, and face fierce price competition after patent expiry. On the other hand, in systems that rely on administered prices, penetration by generic drugs tends to be rather limited. Its descriptive and preliminary nature notwithstanding, our analysis seems to have relevant implications at different levels of generality, especially for Europe.","Magazzini, Laura;Pammolli, Fabio;Riccaboni, Massimo",6505468481;6603423982;6603650921

Firm size growth is analyzed in terms of two basic mechanisms, i.e., the increase of the number of new elementary business units and their size growth. We find a power-law relationship between size and the variance of growth rates for both firms and products, with an exponent between -0.17 and -0.15, with a remarkable stability upon aggregation. We then introduce a simple and general model of proportional growth for both the number of firm independent constituent units and their size, which conveys a good representation of the empirical evidences. This general and plausible generative process can account for the observed scaling in a wide variety of economic and industrial systems.

The firms' patterns of regional, national and international collaboration with other firms and with universities is analyzed, as well as the differing collaborative patterns of small versus large firm. In addressing the theoretical questions about the relative importance of co-location for innovation, the article also provides an empirical overview of the Swedish biotech-pharma sector, especially trends over time.

Given the complexity of the task, we follow a semi-inductivist approach, combining quantitative empirical analyses and simulative exercises. We show that the topological properties of the R&D network in pharmaceuticals are the result of neither a purely random nor of a cumulative process of growth. Instead, they emerge from a mixture of the two generative processes, under a regime of intense and stable entry. This paper should be considered only as a first step towards the understanding of some general determinants of industry networks growth. Despite its limitations, it provides a parsimonious and general framework to reverse engineer the growth of networks in different industries. Some of the current limitations of our analysis could be overcome, in the future, based on a higher availability of data on real systems and, in particular, of detailed topological and economic information on real-world networks. While currently such data are rare, the increasing interest in industrial networks should soon lead to the development of suitable data sets, offering further guidance for modelling and interpreting the growth of these complex and important economic systems.","Riccaboni, Massimo;Pammolli, Fabio",6603650921;6603423982

Our analysis reveals the existence of a complex set of regimes of firm growth within the network, providing additional evidence supporting prediction that both growth and innovative activities of large and small firms respond, even within a given industry, to considerably different technological and economic factors. Moreover, the paper shows, in the context of a specific industry and by means of a series of preliminary and explorative empirical analyses, that information on the topological properties of a given industrial settings and on roles/positions of organizations within it can be used to disentangle some fundamental generative processes underlying observed processes of growth.

Based on an empirical analysis of two different industrial settings (life sciences, LS; information and communication technologies, ICT), it investigates network growth and firm growth in networks. We find a remarkable correspondence between a few fundamental findings of the ‘old’ stochastic approach to the analysis of firm internal growth, and empirically observed patterns of firm external growth through collaborative agreements. We show that scale-free behavior in real-world industrial networks can be accounted for by a general and parsimonious model, originally developed by Herbert Simon in 1955, based on entry and proportional growth. However, relevant departures from the stochastic benchmark are revealed that cannot be ascribed to the effect of mergers and acquisitions (M & As) and growth autocorrelation. Moreover, different regimes of growth are found to be at work in the life sciences for originators versus developers of new business opportunities, reflecting the fact that growth is driven by specialization and division of labor in the processes of generation and attraction/development of technological opportunities. © Elsevier Science Ltd.

Understanding cross-national differences in the organization of innovative labor in the life sciences requires attention to the structure and evolution of biomedical networks involving public research organizations (universities, government laboratories, nonprofit research institutes, and research hospitals), science-based biotechnology firms, and multinational pharmaceutical corporations. We use network visualization methods and correspondence analyses to demonstrate that innovative research in biomedicine has its origins in regional clusters in the United States and in European nations. But the scientific and organizational composition of these regions varies in consequential ways. In the United States, public research organizations and small firms conduct R&D across multiple therapeutic areas and stages of the development process. Ties within and across these regions link small firms and diverse public institutions, contributing to the development of a robust national network. In contrast, the European story is one of regional specialization with a less diverse group of public research organizations working in a smaller number of therapeutic areas. European institutes develop local connections to small firms working on similar scientific problems, while cross-national linkages of European regional clusters typically involve large pharmaceutical corporations. We show that the roles of large and small firms differ in the United States and Europe, arguing that the greater heterogeneity of the U.S. system is based on much closer integration of basic science and clinical development.","Owen-Smith, Jason;Riccaboni, Massimo;Pammolli, Fabio;Powell, Walter W.",6602306116;6603650921;6603423982;7202937821

Using a comprehensive dataset, built by the authors integrating several sources in the industry, the dynamics of the network over time is extensively analyzed.

The evolution of the network has occurred without relevant deformations in the core-periphery profile. With regards to age-dependent propensity to collaborate, the paper finds that the extent of inter-generational collaboration is much more significant than intra-generational collaboration. In addition, the propensity of firms of a given generation to enter into collaboration with firms of a different generation increases with the distance between the two, while the total number of intra-generational collaborations decreases over time and, moreover, tends to decrease for most recent generations.

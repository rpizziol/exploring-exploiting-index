10.1016/j.automatica.2023.111411,0,"In safety-critical applications that rely on the solution of an optimization problem, the certification of the optimization algorithm is of vital importance. Certification and suboptimality results are available for a wide range of optimization algorithms. However, a typical underlying assumption is that the operations performed by the algorithm are exact, i.e., that there is no numerical error during the mathematical operations, which is hardly a valid assumption in a real hardware implementation. This is particularly true in the case of fixed-point hardware, where computational inaccuracies are not uncommon. This article presents a certification procedure for the proximal gradient method for box-constrained QP problems implemented in fixed-point arithmetic. The procedure provides a method to select the minimal fractional precision required to obtain a certain suboptimality bound, indicating the maximum number of iterations of the optimization method required to obtain it. The procedure makes use of formal verification methods to provide arbitrarily tight bounds on the suboptimality guarantee. We apply the proposed certification procedure on the implementation of a non-trivial model predictive controller on 32-bit fixed-point hardware.","Krupa, Pablo;Inverso, Omar;Tribastone, Mirco;Bemporad, Alberto",57205380533;55608826400;15123357400;7005030586
10.1186/s12859-023-05326-9,0,"Background: Boolean Networks (BNs) are a popular dynamical model in biology where the state of each component is represented by a variable taking binary values that express, for instance, activation/deactivation or high/low concentrations. Unfortunately, these models suffer from the state space explosion, i.e., there are exponentially many states in the number of BN variables, which hampers their analysis. Results: We present Boolean Backward Equivalence (BBE), a novel reduction technique for BNs which collapses system variables that, if initialized with same value, maintain matching values in all states. A large-scale validation on 86 models from two online model repositories reveals that BBE is effective, since it is able to reduce more than 90% of the models. Furthermore, on such models we also show that BBE brings notable analysis speed-ups, both in terms of state space generation and steady-state analysis. In several cases, BBE allowed the analysis of models that were originally intractable due to the complexity. On two selected case studies, we show how one can tune the reduction power of BBE using model-specific information to preserve all dynamics of interest, and selectively exclude behavior that does not have biological relevance. Conclusions: BBE complements existing reduction methods, preserving properties that other reduction methods fail to reproduce, and vice versa. BBE drops all and only the dynamics, including attractors, originating from states where BBE-equivalent variables have been initialized with different activation values The remaining part of the dynamics is preserved exactly, including the length of the preserved attractors, and their reachability from given initial conditions, without adding any spurious behaviours. Given that BBE is a model-to-model reduction technique, it can be combined with further reduction methods for BNs.","Argyris, Georgios A.;Lluch Lafuente, Alberto;Tribastone, Mirco;Tschaikowski, Max;Vandin, Andrea",57226333405;9245337700;15123357400;55366841000;36662971300
10.1109/TAC.2023.3244093,0,"—The assumption of perfect knowledge of rate parameters in continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) is undermined when confronted with reality, where they may be uncertain due to lack of information or because of measurement noise. Here, we consider uncertain CTMCs (UCTMCs), where rates are assumed to vary nondeterministically with time from bounded continuous intervals. A UCTMC can be, therefore, seen as a specific type of Markov decision process for which the analysis is computationally difficult. To tackle this, we develop a theory of minimization, which generalizes the notion of lumpability for CTMCs. Our first result is a quantitative and logical characterization of minimization. Specifically, we show that the reduced UCTMC model has a macrostate for each block of a partition of the state space, which preserves value functions and logical formulae whenever rewards are equal within each block. The second result is an efficient minimization algorithm for UCTMCs by means of partition refinement. As an application, we show that reductions in a number of CTMC benchmark models are robust with respect to uncertainties in original rates.","Cardelli, Luca;Grosu, Radu;Larsen, Kim Guldstrand;Tribastone, Mirco;Tschaikowski, Max;Vandin, Andrea",57202811042;6601973195;7202662806;15123357400;55366841000;36662971300

In this paper we consider this problem for nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with polynomial derivatives. We introduce a model reduction technique based on approximate differential equivalence, i.e., a partition of the set of ODE variables that performs an aggregation when the variables are governed by nearby derivatives. We develop algorithms to (i) compute the largest approximate differential equivalence; (ii) construct an approximately reduced model from the original one via an appropriate perturbation of the coefficients of the polynomials; and (iii) provide a formal certificate on the quality of the approximation as an error bound, computed as an over-approximation of the reachable set of the reduced model.

Surprisingly, assessing how the MS designs affect performance is still a challenging issue, which is generally tackled by extensive and expensive profiling. In this paper, we propose μ P, a novel development framework for MS applications where performance can be predicted by design. μ P offers an API that automatically generates a per-formance model based on Layered Queuing Networks (LQNs) without requiring any development effort beyond writing the actual system code. The model can then be queried to predict performance metrics such as response time and utilization of individual microservices. We validate μ P on four benchmarks taken from the literature. The results show the effectiveness of μ P in accurately predicting performance due to increasing user load, vertical and horizontal scaling. We report prediction errors for response times consistently lower than 10% across a wide range of operating conditions.","Garbi, Giulio;Incerto, Emilio;Tribastone, Mirco",57202405054;56815042800;15123357400

To address this, model reduction techniques can be used to project the system onto a lower-dimensional state space. Constrained lumping can reduce systems of ordinary differential equations with polynomial derivatives up to linear combinations of the original variables while preserving specific output variables of interest. Exact reductions may be too restrictive in practice for biological systems since quantitative information is often uncertain or subject to estimations and measurement errors. This might come at the cost of limiting the actual aggregation power of exact reduction techniques. We propose an extension of exact constrained lumping which relaxes the exactness requirements up to a given tolerance parameter ε. We prove that the accuracy, i.e., the difference between the output variables in the original and reduced model, is in the order of ε. Furthermore, we provide a heuristic algorithm to find the smallest ε for a given maximal approximation error. Finally, we demonstrate the approach in biological models from the literature by providing coarser aggregations than exact lumping while accurately capturing the original system dynamics.","Leguizamon-Robayo, Alexander;Jiménez-Pastor, Antonio;Tribastone, Micro;Tschaikowski, Max;Vandin, Andrea",57983272600;56764493700;15123357400;55366841000;36662971300
10.1109/LICS56636.2023.10175697,0,"Quantitative notions of bisimulation are well-known tools for the minimization of dynamical models such as Markov chains and ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In forward bisimulations, each state in the quotient model represents an equivalence class and the dynamical evolution gives the overall sum of its members in the original model. Here we introduce generalized forward bisimulation (GFB) for dynamical systems over commutative monoids and develop a partition refinement algorithm to compute the coarsest one. When the monoid is (ℝ,+), we recover probabilistic bisimulation for Markov chains and more recent forward bisimulations for nonlinear ODEs. Using (ℝ,•) we get nonlinear reductions for discrete-time dynamical systems and ODEs where each variable in the quotient model represents the product of original variables in the equivalence class. When the domain is a finite set such as the Booleans B, we can apply GFB to Boolean networks (BN), a widely used dynamical model in computational biology. Using a prototype implementation of our minimization algorithm for GFB, we find disjunction- and conjunction-preserving reductions on 60 BN from two well-known repositories, and demonstrate the obtained analysis speed-ups. We also provide the biological interpretation of the reduction obtained for two selected BN, and we show how GFB enables the analysis of a large one that could not be analyzed otherwise.

When the original state space is bounded, this procedure may significantly reduce the number of the states while returning an approximate master equation that still retains good accuracy. We present h-scaling together with some theoretical results on asymptotic correctness and numerical examples taken from the performance evaluation literature.

10.1007/978-3-031-16336-4_9,1,"Models of complex systems often consist of state variables with structurally similar dynamics that differ in the specific values of some parameters. Examples are multi-class epidemiological models, chemical reaction networks describing multiple components (e.g., binding sites) with equivalent functional behavior, and models of electric circuits with replicated designs. In these cases, the analysis may be expensive due to the model size. Here we consider models defined as systems of polynomial ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with positive solutions. We present an algorithm to reduce the computational cost by transforming the original ODE model into one for which we can compute an appropriate over-approximation on a smaller set of state variables. The algorithm is based on the theory of differential inequalities and consists of two steps. The first step computes a differential hull, which is an ODE system providing lower and upper bounds for each state variable. The hull is constructed such that variables with structurally similar dynamics but originally different parameters may now be represented by the same lower and upper bounds. Based on this, the second step exploits already developed notions of exact model reduction for ODEs to lump such variables. The algorithm is showcased on several case studies and its results are favourably compared against CORA, a well-known tool for reachability analysis of dynamical systems.","Squillace, Giuseppe;Tribastone, Mirco;Tschaikowski, Max;Vandin, Andrea",57511667400;15123357400;55366841000;36662971300

Furthermore, by an appropriate encoding of kinetic parameters as additional species, the method can establish equivalences that do not depend on specific values of the parameters. The method is supported by an efficient algorithm to compute the largest species equivalence, thus the maximal lumping.

The deterministic rate equation (DRE) gives a macroscopic approximation as a compact system of differential equations that estimate the average populations for each species, but it may be inaccurate in the case of nonlinear interaction dynamics. Here we propose finite-state expansion (FSE), an analytical method mediating between the microscopic and the macroscopic interpretations of a stochastic reaction network by coupling the master equation dynamics of a chosen subset of the discrete state space with the mean population dynamics of the DRE. An algorithm translates a network into an expanded one where each discrete state is represented as a further distinct species.

We develop a notion of lumpability which identifies a partition of states where each block preserves the reachable set of the sum of its probabilities, essentially lifting the well-known CTMC ordinary lumpability to the uncertain setting. We proceed with this analogy with two further contributions: a logical characterization of uncertain CTMC lumping in terms of continuous stochastic logic; and a polynomial time and space algorithm for the minimization of uncertain CTMCs by partition refinement, using the CTMC lumping algorithm as an inner step. As a case study, we show that the minimizations in a substantial number of CTMC models reported in the literature are robust with respect to uncertainties around their original, fixed, rate values.","Cardelli, Luca;Grosu, Radu;Larsen, Kim G.;Tribastone, Mirco;Tschaikowski, Max;Vandin, Andrea",57202811042;6601973195;7202662806;15123357400;55366841000;36662971300

Here we present a statistical method that learns a Markov chain directly from a program, by means of execution runs with inputs sampled by given probability distributions. Our technique is based on learning algorithms for so-called variable length Markov chains, which allow us to capture data dependency throughout execution paths by encoding part of the program history into each state of the chain. Our domain-specific adaptation exploits structural information about the program through its control-flow graph.

Second, in the case of general distributed service and abandonment times, convergence to a fluid limit has been either established only for a single queue, or has been given by means of a system of coupled integral equations which does not allow for a numerical solution. By making the mild assumption of Coxian-distributed service and abandonment times, in this paper we address both drawbacks by establishing convergence in probability to a system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using the theory of Kurtz. The presence of abandonments leads in many cases to ODE systems with a global attractor, which is known to be a sufficient condition for the fluid and the stochastic steady state to coincide in the limiting regime.

SMB identifies a lumpable partition of the CTMC state space a priori, in the sense that it is an equivalence relation over species implying that two CTMC states are lumpable when they are invariant with respect to the total population of species within the same equivalence class. We develop an efficient partition-refinement algorithm which computes the largest SMB of a CRN in polynomial time in the number of species and reactions. We also provide an algorithm for obtaining a quotient network from an SMB that induces the lumped CTMC directly, thus avoiding the generation of the state space of the original CRN altogether. In practice, we show that SMB allows significant reductions in a number of models from the literature. Finally, we study SMB with respect to the deterministic semantics of CRNs based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs), where each equation gives the time-course evolution of the concentration of a species. SMB implies forward CRN bisimulation, a recently developed behavioral notion of equivalence for the ODE semantics, in an analogous sense: it yields a smaller ODE system that keeps track of the sums of the solutions for equivalent species.","Cardelli, Luca;Tribastone, Mirco;Tschaikowski, Max;Vandin, Andrea",57202811042;15123357400;55366841000;36662971300

Effectively managing the temperature therefore requires: 1) autonomous detection of changes in application workload and 2) appropriate selection of control levers to manage thermal profiles of these workloads. In this paper, we propose a technique for workload change detection using density ratio-based statistical divergence between overlapping sliding windows of CPU performance statistics. This is integrated in a runtime approach for thermal management, which uses reinforcement learning to select workload-specific thermal control levers by sampling on-board thermal sensors. Identified control levers override the OSs native thread allocation decision and scale hardware voltage-frequency to improve average temperature, peak temperature, and thermal cycling. The proposed approach is validated through its implementation as a hierarchical runtime manager for Linux, with heuristic-based thread affinity selected from the upper hierarchy to reduce thermal cycling and learning-based voltage-frequency selected from the lower hierarchy to reduce average and peak temperatures. Experiments conducted with mobile, embedded, and high performance applications on ARM-based embedded systems demonstrate that the proposed approach increases workload change detection accuracy by an average ${3.4\times }$ , reducing the average temperature by 4 °C-25 °C, peak temperature by 6 °C-24 °C, and thermal cycling by 7%-35% over state-of-the-art approaches.","Das, Anup;Merrett, Geoff V.;Tribastone, Mirco;Al-Hashimi, Bashir M.",56883595200;12142708100;15123357400;7005831322

For a fixed function, does increased network complexity reduce noise, beyond the mere increase of overall molecular counts? If so, complexity could provide an advantage counteracting the costs involved in maintaining larger networks. For that purpose, we investigate how noise affects multistable systems, where a small amount of noise could lead to very different outcomes; thus we turn to biochemical switches. Our method for comparing networks of different structure and complexity is to place them in conditions where they produce exactly the same deterministic function. We are then in a good position to compare their noise characteristics relatively to their identical deterministic traces. We show that more complex networks are better at coping with both intrinsic and extrinsic noise. Intrinsic noise tends to decrease with complexity, and extrinsic noise tends to have less impact.

The second is due to massive parameter spaces to be explored, but such that computations cannot be reused across model instances. In this paper, we efficiently analyze many queuing models with the distinctive feature of more accurately capturing variability and uncertainty of execution rates by incorporating general (i.e., non-exponential) distributions. Applying product-line engineering methods, we consider a family of models generated by a core that evolves into concrete instances by applying simple delta operations affecting both the topology and the model's parameters. State explosion is tackled by turning to a scalable approximation based on ordinary differential equations.

This interpretation is particularly convenient when sequential components characterised by small local state spaces are present in many independent copies. While the traditional Markovian interpretation causes state-space explosion, fluid semantics is independent from the multiplicities of the sequential components present in the model, just associating a single ordinary differential equation (ODE) with each local state. In this paper we analyse the case of a process algebra model inducing a large ODE system. Previous work, known as exact fluid lumpability, requires two symmetries: ODE aggregation is possible for processes that i) are isomorphic and that ii) are present with the same multiplicities. We first relax the latter requirement by introducing the notion of ordinary fluid lumpability, which yields an ODE system where the sum of the aggregated variables is preserved exactly. Then, we consider approximate variants of both notions of lumpability which make nearby processes symmetric after a perturbation of their parameters. We prove that small perturbations yield nearby differential trajectories. We carry out our study in the context of a process algebra that unifies two synchronisation semantics that are well studied in the literature, useful for the modelling of computer systems and chemical networks, respectively.

These methods are particularly suitable in situations which present large populations of simple interacting objects characterised by small local state spaces, since they require the analysis of a problem which is insensitive to the population sizes but is dependent only on the size of the local state spaces. This paper studies the case when the replicated objects are best described as composites which consist of smaller simple objects. A congenial formal modelling framework for situations of this kind may be given by stochastic process algebra. Using PEPA as a representative case, we find that fluid models with replicated copies of composite processes do not scale well with increasing population sizes, thus rendering intractable the analysis of the underlying system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We call this problem continuous state-space explosion, by analogy with its counterpart phenomenon in discrete state spaces. The main contribution of this paper is a result of equivalence that simplifies, in an exact way, the potentially massive ODE system arising in those circumstances to one whose size is independent from all the multiplicities in the model.

10.1016/j.tcs.2013.07.029,13,"Quantitative analysis by means of discrete-state stochastic processes is hindered by the well-known phenomenon of state-space explosion, whereby the size of the state space may have an exponential growth with the number of agents of the system under scrutiny. When the stochastic process underlies a Markovian process algebra model, this problem may be alleviated by suitable notions of behavioural equivalence that induce lumping at the underlying continuous-time Markov chain, establishing an exact relation between a potentially much smaller aggregated chain and the original one. For the analysis of massively parallel systems, however, lumping techniques may not be sufficient to yield a computationally tractable problem. Recently, much work has been directed towards forms of fluid techniques that provide a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) approximating the expected path of the stochastic process. Unfortunately, even fluid models of realistic systems may be too large for feasible analysis. This paper studies a behavioural relation for process algebra with fluid semantics, called projected label equivalence, which is shown to yield an exactly fluid lumpable model, i.e., an aggregated ODE system which can be related to the original one without any loss of information. Project label equivalence relates sequential components of a process term. In general, for any two sequential components that are related in the fluid sense, nothing can be said about their relationship from the stochastic viewpoint. We define and study a notion of well-posedness which allows us to relate fluid lumpability to the stochastic notion of semi-isomorphism, which is a weaker version of the common notion of isomorphism between the doubly labelled transition systems at the basis of the Markovian interpretation.","Tschaikowski, Max;Tribastone, Mirco",55366841000;15123357400

The goal is to describe events that affect performance and reliability such as breakdowns, repairs, or temporary degradations of resource capacities due to exogenous factors. Despite having been studied for decades, models that include both random environments and queueing networks remain difficult to analyse. To cope with this problem, we introduce the blending algorithm, a novel approximation for closed queueing network models in random environments. The algorithm seeks to obtain the stationary solution of the model by iteratively evaluating the dynamics of the system in between state changes of the environment. To make the approach scalable, the computation relies on a fluid approximation of the queueing network model. A validation study on 1800 models shows that blending can save a significant amount of time compared to simulation, with an average accuracy that grows with the number of servers in each station. We also give an interpretation of this technique in terms of Laplace transforms and use this approach to determine convergence properties.","Casale, Giuliano;Tribastone, Mirco;Harrison, Peter G.",21742204200;15123357400;7401612242

This paper proposes an approach to provably exact parameter-space pruning for a class of models of large-scale software systems analyzed with fluid techniques, efficient and scalable deterministic approximations of massively parallel stochastic models. We present a result of monotonicity of fluid solutions with respect to the model parameters, and employ it in the context of optimization programs with evolutionary algorithms by discarding candidate configurations a priori, i.e., without ever solving them, whenever they are proven to give lower fitness than other configurations. An extensive numerical validation shows that this approach yields an average twofold runtime speed-up compared to a baseline optimization algorithm that does not exploit monotonicity.

The process calculus and the numerical analysis are supported by a set of software tools which relieve the modeller of the burden of generating and evaluating a large family of related models. The methods are illustrated on a classical example of Web Service usage in a business-to-business scenario. © 2009 Springer.","Clark, Allan;Gilmore, Stephen;Tribastone, Mirco",55451068400;8983764500;15123357400

There may be many possible service instances available for binding, leading to uncertainty about where service requests will execute. We present a novel Markovian process calculus which allows the formal expression of uncertainty about binding as found in service-oriented computing.

10.1145/1383559.1383569,37,"Recent trends in software engineering lean towards model-centric development methodologies, a context in which the UML plays a crucial role. To provide modellers with quantitative insights into their artifacts, the UML benefits from a framework for software performance evaluation provided by MARTE, the UML profile for model-driven development of Real Time and Embedded Systems. MARTE offers a rich semantics which is general enough to allow different quantitative analysis techniques to act as underlying performance engines. In the present paper we explore the use of the stochastic process algebra PEPA as one such engine, providing a procedure to systematically map activity diagrams onto PEPA models. Independent activity flows are translated into sequential automata which co-ordinate at the synchronisation points expressed by fork and join nodes of the activity. The PEPA performance model is interpreted against a Marko-vian semantics which allows the calculation of performance indices such as throughput and utilisation. We also discuss the implementation of a new software tool powered by the popular Eclipse platform which implements the fully automatic translation from MARTE-annotated UML activity diagrams to PEPA models.

We partially evaluate the state-space of a PEPA model in order to remove uses of the cooperation and hiding operators and compile an arbitrary sub-model into a single sequential component. This transformation is applied to PEPA models which are not in the correct form for the application of the fluid-flow analysis for PEPA [2]. The result of the transformation is a PEPA model which is amenable to fluid-flow analysis but which is strongly equivalent [1] to the input PEPA model and so, by an application of Hillston's theorem, performance results computed from one model are valid for the other.

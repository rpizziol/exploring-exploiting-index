10.1016/j.ecolecon.2023.107924,0,"This study introduces a municipality transition index based on open data and green transition principles. The Municipality Transition Index provides data and a succinct measurement of municipal attributes as defined by green policies at national and local level. We identify four dimensions of interest and 18 key performance indicators, defined at municipality level, and measure factors that directly and indirectly influence the green transition, with a focus on the Green Deal vision embraced by the European Union. The robustness and meaningfulness of the index is tested on a dataset covering all 7904 Italian municipalities. Our results show that computation of the MTI on this sample produces a bell-shaped distribution, suggesting strong geographic disparities and a significant difference between cities, towns and rural areas. The results show the need for policies and tools tailored at municipal level and provide information for practitioners, policy makers and experts from academia, useful for designing tools to underpin investment planning in the framework of the recent National Recovery and Resilience Plan issued by the Italian government. This may be particularly useful for enhancing green-transition-enabling factors that may differ across regions, helping policymakers to promote a smooth and fair transition by monitoring the performance of municipalities as they address the challenge.","Muscillo, Alessio;Re, Simona;Gambacorta, Sergio;Ferrara, Giuseppe;Tagliafierro, Nicola;Borello, Emiliano;Rubino, Alessandro;Facchini, Angelo",57218949192;57282325800;57282166100;57282480200;57283106700;57282480300;7102614022;7102434045

Gox, the dominant Bitcoin exchange from 2011 to early 2014, in order to detect the triangular arbitrage conducted on the platform. To this end, we exploit user identifiers per trade to identify and describe the individual trading patterns of 440 arbitrageurs. Moreover, we introduce proxies for expertise and document that the expert users' distribution of profits first-order stochastically dominates that of non-expert users. Most importantly, by including user fixed effects, we show that expert users make profits on arbitrage by reacting quickly to plausible exogenous variations on the official exchange rates. A small number of expert arbitrageurs are able to conduct the vast majority of the arbitrage actions and systematically yield higher profits: our results provide empirical evidence that arbitrageurs are few and sophisticated users, characterized by the ability to incorporate information and to quickly react to exogenous shocks within short time scale intervals.","Saggese, Pietro;Belmonte, Alessandro;Dimitri, Nicola;Facchini, Angelo;Böhme, Rainer",57219740943;55706331700;6506794176;7102434045;56213351900
10.1038/s41598-022-17508-1,1,"Food webs studies are intrinsically complex and time-consuming. Network data about trophic interaction across different large locations and ecosystems are scarce in comparison with general ecological data, especially if we consider terrestrial habitats. Here we present a complex network strategy to ease the gathering of the information by simplifying the collection of data with a taxonomic key. We test how well the topology of three different food webs retain their structure at the resolution of the nodes across distinct levels of simplification, and we estimate how community detection could be impacted by this strategy. The first level of simplification retains most of the general topological indices; betweenness and trophic levels seem to be consistent and robust even at the higher levels of simplification. This result suggests that generalisation and standardisation, as a good practice in food webs science, could benefit the community, both increasing the amount of open data available and the comparison among them, thus providing support especially for scientists that are new in this field and for exploratory analysis.","Gini, Andrea;Re, Simona;Facchini, Angelo",57314072300;57282325800;7102434045
10.1098/rsif.2022.0226,4,"Repeated polygonal patterns are pervasive in natural forms and structures. These patterns provide inherent structural stability while optimizing strength-per-weight and minimizing construction costs. In echinoids (sea urchins), a visible regularity can be found in the endoskeleton, consisting of a lightweight and resistant micro-trabecular meshwork (stereom). This foam-like structure follows an intrinsic geometrical pattern that has never been investigated. This study aims to analyse and describe it by focusing on the boss of tubercles-spine attachment sites subject to strong mechanical stresses-in the common sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. The boss microstructure was identified as a Voronoi construction characterized by 82% concordance to the computed Voronoi models, a prevalence of hexagonal polygons, and a regularly organized seed distribution. This pattern is interpreted as an evolutionary solution for the construction of the echinoid skeleton using a lightweight microstructural design that optimizes the trabecular arrangement, maximizes the structural strength and minimizes the metabolic costs of secreting calcitic stereom. Hence, this identification is particularly valuable to improve the understanding of the mechanical function of the stereom as well as to effectively model and reconstruct similar structures in view of future applications in biomimetic technologies and designs.","Perricone, Valentina;Grun, Tobias B.;Rendina, Francesco;Marmo, Francesco;Candia Carnevali, Maria Daniela;Kowalewski, Michal;Facchini, Angelo;De Stefano, Mario;Santella, Luigia;Langella, Carla;Micheletti, Alessandra",57195396813;53875934600;57200941314;55223134300;56785865900;35614855500;7102434045;16425540300;7004208243;36198210700;7003492939

10.1186/s13705-021-00300-w,5,"Background: Currently, most of the world’s population lives in cities, and the rapid urbanization of the population is driving increases in the demand for products, goods and services. To effectively design policies for urban sustainability, it is important to understand the trends of flows in energy and materials as they enter and leave a city. This knowledge is essential for determining the key elements characterizing future urban growth and addressing future supply challenges. Methods: This paper presents an analysis of the energy and material flows in the city of Bogotá over the time span from 2001 to 2017. Urban flows are also characterized in terms of their temporal evolution with respect to population growth to compare and identify the changes in the main input flows, wealth production, emissions and waste in the city. Results: The results of the analysis are then compared with those for other selected large urban agglomerations in Latin America and worldwide to highlight similarities and make inferences. The results show that in Bogotá, there was a decrease in some of the material flows, such as the consumption of water and the generation of discharge, in recent years, while there was an increase in the consumption of energy and cement and in the production of CO2 emissions and construction materials. Solid waste production remained relatively stable. With respect to the other large cities considered, we observe that the 10-year growth rates of the flows with respect to population growth are lower in Bogotá, particularly when compared with the other urban agglomerations in Latin America. Conclusions: The findings of this study are important for advancing characterizations of the trends of material and energy flows in cities, and they contribute to the establishment of a benchmark that allows for the definition and evaluation of the different impacts of public policy while promoting the sustainability of Bogotá in the coming decades.","Pardo Martínez, Clara Inés;Alfonso Piña, William;Facchini, Angelo;Cotte Poveda, Alexander",57218534166;55936757000;7102434045;36695759200

However, current simulation tools underestimate their operating costs, which jeopardises their efficient use and deployment. This paper proposes a strategy based on artificial intelligence and time series prediction for the planning and real-time management of a battery energy storage system in a micro-grid acting as a virtual power plant. An economic analysis was performed, and the findings suggested that the state of charge should be managed to avoid economic losses due to cycle ageing. In addition, the battery should be sized correctly to ensure its economic viability, which indicates that it should be optimised according to the load profile of the micro-grid. The proposed management strategy was demonstrated to avoid the economic losses observed with a non-managed storage system. In addition, ensuring that the micro-grid did not deviate from the load profile agreed upon with the transmission system operator was found to increase economic returns, reduce battery degradation and increase self-consumption with the co-benefit of reducing micro-grid fluctuations.","Korjani, Saman;Facchini, Angelo;Mureddu, Mario;Rubino, Alessandro;Damiano, Alfonso",57193868329;7102434045;57195913409;7102614022;7005770813

The truth is that we have just scratched the surface of the research challenges that should be tackled in order to make this vision a reality. Consequently, there is an increasing interest among different research communities (ranging from civil engineering to computer science) and industrial stakeholders in building knowledge discovery pipelines over such data sources. At the same time, this widespread data availability also raises privacy issues that must be considered by both industrial and academic stakeholders. In this paper, we provide a wide perspective on the role that big data have in reshaping cities. The paper covers the main aspects of urban data analytics, focusing on privacy issues, algorithms, applications and services, and georeferenced data from social media. In discussing these aspects, we leverage, as concrete examples and case studies of urban data science tools, the results obtained in the “City of Citizens” thematic area of the Horizon 2020 SoBigData initiative, which includes a virtual research environment with mobility datasets and urban analytics methods developed by several institutions around Europe.

10.3389/frsc.2020.00040,1,"The urban metabolism of Metropolitan Lima, the largest urban agglomeration in Peru, which has recently surpassed 10 million inhabitants, was analyzed in this study. This coastal megacity, located within the Rimac, Chillón, and Lurin watersheds constitutes the socioeconomic center of the country and is the hub of the main import and export routes. A multi-layer approach was used to explore material and energy flows in the Peruvian capital for a 10-year timeframe. Results show that in 2006 the GDP of the 49 districts that shape the metropolitan area of Lima was 105.2 billion USD-PPP, while in 2014 it reached about 200 billion USD-PPP. Based on this growth, we highlight that energy, electricity and water flows experienced a linear increase with respect to GDP, being the electricity consumption in years 2006, 2011 and 2014, 7295, 10,112, and 11,465 GWh, respectively. Regarding demographics, population growth ratios of GDP (650%), electricity consumption (400%), solid waste production (250%), and water (100%) confirm the results of super linear scaling found by Kennedy et al. (2015) for the other megacities. Finally, the increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions was computed following an important shift in the primary energy sources to produce electricity. The most important change was linked to the shift from hydropower to natural gas, a trend that initiated in 2006. For instance, in 2001 79% of the total electricity production came from hydropower, whereas in 2014 69% was linked to natural gas. This shift produced an increase of GHG emissions of more than 200% in 2014 when compared to the electricity generation mix of 2001. Following these results, we strongly encourage policies for the decarbonization of the electricity production sector, as well as for mobility infrastructures, e.g., electric public and transport sector, with a progressive shift toward electric mobility.","Facchini, Angelo;Mele, R.;Caldarelli, Guido",7102434045;7004989731;55139905100

The proposed strategy can be easily integrated in a decision support system for the planning of renewable energy sources. Therefore, providing policy/decision makers with an additional tool. We test our strategy on a set of case studies including a real-case based on literature data for solar and wind sources, and discuss how to extend the computation to non-Gaussian sources.

Similar results are obtained by means of spectral analysis on the price series, showing a significant reduction in its variability. The results of our analysis suggest that a dynamical regime shift of the price occurred, and such shift is linked to the GC change whereby shorter GC intervals facilitate short-term forecasting on electricity demand and better reliability on the supply side.

To this aim we study the relation between centrality metrics and voltage fluctuations in power grids in presence of high penetration of renewable energy sources and storage systems. For testing purposes we consider two prototypical IEEE networks and we compute the correlation between node centrality (namely Eigenvector, Closeness, Pagerank, Betweenness) and voltage fluctuations in presence of intermittent renewable energy generators and intermittent loads measured from domestic users. We show that the topological characteristics of the power networks are able to identify the optimal positioning of active and reactive power compensators (such as energy storage systems) used to reduce voltage fluctuations according to the common quality of service standards. Results show that, among the different metrics, eigenvector centrality shows a statistically significant exponential correlation with the reduction of voltage fluctuations. This finding confirms the technical know-how for which storage systems are heuristically positioned far from supply reactive nodes.

10.3390/en10111916,17,"In recent years, many studies have proposed the use of energy storage systems (ESSs) for the mitigation of renewable energy source (RES) intermittent power output. However, the correct estimation of the ESS degradation costs is still an open issue, due to the difficult estimation of their aging in the presence of intermittent power inputs. This is particularly true for battery ESSs (BESSs), which have been proven to exhibit complex aging functions. Unfortunately, this collides with considering aging costs when performing ESS planning and management procedures, which are crucial for the exploitation of this technology. In order to overcome this issue, this paper presents the genetic algorithm-based multi-period optimal power flow (GA-MPOPF) procedure, which aims to economically optimize the management of ESSs by taking into account their degradation costs. The proposed methodology has been tested in two different applications: the planning of the correct positioning of a Li-ion BESS in the PG& E 69 bus network in the presence of high RES penetration, and the definition of its management strategy.

In this paper we compare the energy metabolism in 27 of the world's megacities including details of mobile and stationary energy consumption patterns, fuels used, as well as end-use patterns and electricity generation mix. Our results show that per capita total energy consumption scales with urban population density according to a power law characterized by the universal −3/4 scaling, pointing out that compact cities are more energy efficient with respect to dispersed cities. By comparing energy sources and sectoral end use, also focusing on electricity use and generation source, we found a significant regionalization of energy metabolism, and we discuss the implication for resilience, infrastructure planning, GHG emissions, and policies for infrastructure decarbonization. The comparison of the energy metabolism can lead to a more appropriate management of energy use patterns and electricity generation mix in megacities, giving insights on strategies to improve urban energy efficiency and reducing environmental pressure of megacities.","Facchini, Angelo;Kennedy, Chris;Stewart, Iain;Mele, Renata",7102434045;7402164677;56327265000;7004989731

Water is fundamental for people, and for infrastructures like energy, waste, and food production. Water sustainability is therefore a fundamental aspect to be addressed by an efficient use of the resources and by mainteining high quality standards. Hence, water industry and water infrastructure need a deep transformation; in this paper we present a framework based on complex systems and management science as a possible pathway to reshape and optimize the performance of the water infrastructure to cope with the complexity of todays’ challenges. To this aim, we propose the framework Acque 2.0 (Water 2.0), where we point out how the increase of the infrastructural resilience and of the overall quality of service can be attained by integrating models, algorithms and numerical methods like network simulations and big data analytics for the predictive maintenance of water networks.

We analyze the role of electric utilities as important actors to catalyze the transition to electric cites, drawing upon data for the world's 27 megacities. Progress towards the ideal electric city is most advanced for Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires for low carbon electricity, while Indian megacities have relatively high use of carbon-intensive electricity as a percentage of total energy use. There is wide variety in the structure of markets for electricity provision in megacities, with a dominant, public utility being the most common model. We review literature on electricity sector business models and broadly propose future models dependent on the predominance of locally dispersed generation and the nature of the ownership of the electric grid within the city. Where a high proportion of electricity can be provided by locally distributed supply within a city, the role of utilities could predominantly become that of enabler of exchange with the grid, but new pricing structures are required. A further challenge for utilities in enabling the electric city is to provide a higher level of resilience to events that disrupt power supply.","Kennedy, Chris;Stewart, Iain D.;Facchini, Angelo;Mele, Renata",7402164677;56327265000;7102434045;7004989731

The Italian Transmission System Operator (TSO) and the Distribution System Operator (DSO), worked on a new infrastructural model, based on electronic meters and information technology. In pursuing this objective it is crucial importance to understand how even more larger shares of renewable energy can be fully integrated, providing a constant and reliable energy background over space and time. This is particularly true for intermittent sources as photovoltaic installations due to the fine-grained distribution of them across the Country. In this work we use an over-simplified model to characterize the Italian power grid as a graph whose nodes are Italian municipalities and the edges cross the administrative boundaries between a selected municipality and its first neighbours, following a Delaunay triangulation. Our aim is to describe the power flow as a diffusion process over a network, and using open data on the solar irradiation at the ground level, we estimate the production of photovoltaic energy in each node.

Accessing, sharing, and managing energy and material resources is particularly critical for megacities, which face enormous social stresses because of their sheer size and complexity. Here we quantify the energy and material flows through the world's 27 megacities with populations greater than 10 million people as of 2010. Collectively the resource flows through megacities are largely consistent with scaling laws established in the emerging science of cities. Correlations are established for electricity consumption, heating and industrial fuel use, ground transportation energy use, water consumption, waste generation, and steel production in terms of heating-degree-days, urban form, economic activity, and population growth. The results help identify megacities exhibiting high and low levels of consumption and those making efficient use of resources. The correlation between per capita electricity use and urbanized area per capita is shown to be a consequence of gross building floor area per capita, which is found to increase for lower-density cities. Many of the megacities are growing rapidly in population but are growing even faster in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) and energy use.

A new approach to load forecasting in the presence of AD is therefore proposed. The approach is based on a decomposition of the load into its components, namely the base load (representing different seasonal patterns), and a residual term depending both on stochastic fluctuations and AD effects. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated through a numerical example.

10.1103/PhysRevE.72.021915,32,"Recurrence plots of the calls of the Nomascus concolor (Western black crested gibbon) and Hylobates lar (White-handed gibbon) show characteristic circular, curved, and hyperbolic patterns superimposed to the main temporal scale of the signal. It is shown that these patterns are related to particular nonstationarities in the signal. Some of them can be reproduced by artificial signals like frequency modulated sinusoids and sinusoids with time divergent frequency. These modulations are too faint to be resolved by conventional time-frequency analysis with similar precision. Therefore, recurrence plots act as a magnifying glass for the detection of multiple temporal scales in slightly modulated signals. The detected phenomena in these acoustic signals can be explained in the biomechanical context by taking in account the role of the muscles controlling the vocal folds. © 2005 The American Physical Society.","Facchini, A.;Kantz, H.;Tiezzi, E.",7102434045;7005826185;58439837400
10.1016/j.physleta.2005.02.048,22,"The cries of several full term newborns, recorded during blood sampling, were analyzed. Spectrograms showed the appearance of irregular patterns related to the pain assessed using the method of the DAN scale [Arch. Pediatr. 4 (1997) 623]. In particular, the appearance of noise concentration patterns (NP) in spectrograms was related to the increase of the pain suffered by the newborns. In this scenario, pain constitutes a bifurcation parameter for the vocal folds dynamic, inducing a Ruelle-Takens-Newhouse chaotic transition. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

,5,"Considering the city as a peculiar kind of ecosystem, this paper explores the potential of a metabolic approach to urban development interpretation, proposing an enhanced metabolic urban model. This new metabolic model strongly focuses on the influence that institutional activities have on urban sustainability. Such activities - like planning and other decisional processes - are considered as an important feedback of urban dynamics. This last updating aims at connecting the conceptual modelling to urban governance.","Costa, A.;Marchettini, N.;Facchini, A.",7401876638;56206691600;7102434045
,0,"We present interesting experimental results obtained from an observational study of the cries of several newborns aged between 24 and 48 hours, recorded during the phase of blood sampling. Analysis performed put in evidence that the emitted vocalization becomes more irregular and aperiodic with the increase of the pain suffered by the newborn. We think that this phenomenon can be explained by taking into account some behaviors observed in the model by Ishizaka and Flanagan of the vocal folds. Chaotic behaviors have been found in the cries of healthy infants as well as infants with several perinatal complications. We show that these phenomena also appear in healthy infants and are related to the newborn's pain intensity. Under the point of view of the dissipative systems, pain acts as a bifurcation parameter for the motion of the vocal folds. These hypothesis are supported by the recurrence plot analysis performed on the cries and, in particular the shape and the patterns observed in the plots are typical of chaotic transitions observed in dissipative systems.","Tiezzi, E.

,2,"An environmental accounting methodology, called emergy analysis that can assess the sustainability of the Province of Siena was developed. The methodology was able to compare the value of human, and natural systems on a common basis: the quantity of solar energy directly, and indirectly required for a process. The emergy indicators defined a Province with a low environmental loading ratio, to a low population density, and internal production of electricity by means of geothermal heat. It was suggested that the assessment of the environmental sustainability of the Province of Siena required a holistic approach because of the complexity of the system.","Niccolucci, V.;Ridolfi, R.;Facchini, A.",6602509347;7003995697;7102434045
10.1121/1.1624071,15,"Chaos, oscillations, instabilities, and intermittency represent only some nonlinear examples apparent in the natural world. These phenomena appear in any field of study, and advances in complex and nonlinear dynamic techniques bring about opportunities to better understand animal signals. In this work an analysis method is suggested based on the characterization of the vocal-fold dynamics by means of the nonlinear time-series analysis, and by the computations of the parameters typical of chaotic oscillations: Attractor reconstruction, spectrum of Lyapunov exponents, and maximum Lyapunov exponent were used to reconstruct the dynamic of the vocal folds. Identifying a sort of vocal fingerprint can be useful in biodiversity monitoring and understanding the health status of a given animal.

,0,"In spite of its apparent complexity and randomness, time evolution of nonlinear dynamical systems can be often described by resorting to a low number of degrees of freedom. This is the case of mechanical apparatuses as well as of biological activities such as cell cycles and organs physiology. With reference to the latter, nonlinear phenomena and chaos have been also proven to occur in the vocal emission of living organisms as a result of both the vocal apparatus physiology and the turbulent fluid dynamics. The complexity of the vocal emissions and their apparent correlation with the social behaviours displayed make the Cervus Elaphus Corsicanus one interesting case. The nonlinear dynamics techniques used to characterise vocalisation dynamics provide direct experimental evidence for the occurrence of chaos in the vocalising behaviour of Cervus Elaphus Corsicanus.","Rustici, M.;Lai, G.;Facchini, A.;Bastianoni, S.",7003688470;7102926465;7102434045;56212802500
,0,"From a thermodynamic point of view, sustainability roots itself within a global balance. Shifting our sights from global to local contexts, we always risk to loose contact with such a balance. In nowadays multi-connected, dematerialized economy is quite impossible to trace the real effects of local dynamics: the urban region is crumbled over the earth's face. We have to deal with the role of urban or local systems, and to do this we need a multi-layered perspective. Every interpretative act is built showing up an object over a background of shared knowledge. We first need to build such a background, nesting then our statements about ""local"" sustainability in a series, or a hierarchy of scenarios, always reconnecting ourselves to largest contexts. We know that the global balance is in the red, using indicators like natural capital accounting, greenhouse gas inventory and so on, but we have to be aware that the only closed system, the only boundary, is the biosphere. So every city, every local economic system, produces services, goods and culture, playing a complex role in the general dynamic of global sustainability, witch cannot be described as a simple numeric balance. The same energy or emergy unit has very different ""meanings"" in Mumbay or in Detroit. What we need is a new geography, built with physical, thermodynamic and economic indicators: we would like to consider this kind of description as the geographical side of Ecological Economics.","Rosini, M.;Facchini, A.;Picchi, M.

10.1017/S0957423922000091,0,"Do Avicenna's extant works preserve any trace of his now-lost early philosophical production? This paper considers a hitherto neglected text, namely the chapter On Hypothetical Propositions from Avicenna's Concise Treatise on the Principles of Logic (Risāla mūÇ aza fī uá ūl al-maná iq, henceforth: RM). The new evidence offered by the RM chapter in question will lead to a different reading of another well-known passage of Avicenna's reworking of Aristotle's Prior Analytics (Qiyās) from the Book of Healing (Kitāb al-šifāÊ ). The clues gathered from an analysis of these two works will finally lead us to ponder the possibility that Avicenna may in fact have composed a (now lost) work on hypothetical propositions and syllogisms. Since Avicenna's RM is to date unedited, an edition, as well as an English translation of the relevant chapter, is also provided in the Appendix of this paper.","Di Vincenzo, Silvia",56790157000
10.1080/09608788.2022.2123779,0,"Avicenna’s ground-breaking view of logic as both a tool for other sciences and a science in its own right has already attracted scholars’ attention and has been studied in several different respects. The present paper aims to address a specific issue entailed by considering logic as a science in its own right: that is, assessing the relation in which logic as a science stands to the other sciences, and particularly to metaphysics and psychology. The inquiry will focus on a fundamental, yet tricky, passage of chapter I.4 of Avicenna’s Kitāb al-Madḫal, the opening work of his most comprehensive philosophical summa, the Kitāb al-Šifāʾ (Book of Healing). Due to the obscurity of some of Avicenna’s references, chapter I.4 “on the subject-matter of logic” has stimulated numerous attempts at interpretation from the Middle Ages to today. In this paper, I will attempt to provide a new reading of the chapter in light of Avicenna’s definition of the epistemological status of science in Burhān II.7.","Di Vincenzo, Silvia",56790157000
10.1163/1878464X-01202003,0,"ms Cambridge, University Library, Or. 658 is a collection of eleven texts transmitted in anonymous and untitled form whose precise content has to date remained obscure. On closer inspection, however, the manuscript turns out to be a so-far neglected witness of some authentic and pseudepigraph works of, among others, Avicenna (d. 427/1037) and Mulla sadra (d. 1050/1640-1641). This paper aims to provide an identification of all the works contained therein, along with a hypothetical reconstruction of the milieu in which the codex was produced.","Di Vincenzo, Silvia",56790157000
,0,"The present study focuses on Albert the Great’s reception of Arabic sources — especially of Avicenna — in his commentary on the Isagoge, i.e., the Super Porphyrium de V Universalibus. The paper is articulated into two main sections (I and II) and six appendixes (A-F). The first section (I) offers a preliminary evaluation of Albert’s use of Arabic sources in the SP. The second section (II) aims to assess Avicenna’s impact on Albert from the viewpoint of his doctrinal digressions. Two major doctrines of Avicenna are integrated into Albert’s theory of the predicables: first, the Avicennian distinction between an ontological consideration of the predicables, which pertains to metaphysics, and a logical one, which pertains to logic; second, Avicenna’s redefinition of the epistemological status of logic, which is reassessed as a science in its own right with its own subject-matter, ceasing to be considered as a mere instrument for the other sciences. Both points were crucial to the thirteenth-century debate on the subject-matter of logic and the universal predicables: a comparison between Albert the Great’s and Robert Kilwardby’s treatments of these themes shows that Albert might have engaged in a debate with his colleagues which has gone unnoticed so far. It is argued that the recourse to Avicenna has provided Albert with a set of arguments which, assimilated and rearranged in his theory of the universal predicables, enabled him to elaborate original answers to the problems differently faced by his contemporaries.","Di Vincenzo, Silvia",56790157000
10.1017/S095742391700008X,2,"Nine manuscripts preserving Avicenna's Kitāb al-Šifā' share a set of identical marginal glosses to the section of Logic. One of these manuscripts reports, at the end of each of the glosses, a certificate of transmission ascribing them to the theologian and philosopher Fahr al-Dīn al-Rāzī (d. 606H/1210), which provides some material evidence of the existence of a flourishing exegetical activity on the Kitāb al-Šifā' during the twelfth-thirteenth century, in spite of the apparent lack of commentaries on the text in that period. The present paper provides an edition of the so far unknown hāšiyāt to Avicenna's Kitāb al-Šifā' by al-Rāzī, with an attempt at reconstructing their tradition and contextualizing them within al-Rāzī's exegetical and teaching activity.","Di Vincenzo, Silvia",56790157000
,0,"The paper is a review of Roland Hissette’s critical edition of the Latin translation of Averroes’ Middle Commentary on Porphyry’s Isagoge published in 2016 within the framework of the ‘Averroes Latinus’ project. The analysis of Hissette’s edition offered the occasion of a further inquiry into a number of passages of Averroes’ Commentary, compared to their Hebrew translation edited by H. A. Davidson in 1969. As a result of this inquiry, the paper proposes the hypothesis that some relevant points of Averroes’ Middle Commentary on Porphyry’s Isagoge might resort to Avicenna’s major reworking on the Isagoge, the Kitāb al-Mad{caron below}al of the Šifā', as a source.","Di Vincenzo, Silvia",56790157000
,1,"The present paper concerns the textual tradition of Avicenna’s reworking of Porphyry’s Isagoge (Kitab al-Madhal) opening the Logic section of Avicenna’s Book of the Cure (Kitāb al-Šifā). The present inquiry, conducted on 59 Arabic manuscripts and on the twelfth-century Latin translation of the work, has as its starting point the observation that the Latin translation, together with 11 Arabic manuscripts and the early indirect tradition of the work, witnesses the existence of a different, shorter, version of some passages of the text than that attested by most of the manuscripts. I shall suggest that one of the possibilities that should at least be considered in the attempt to explain this phenomenon is that of considering the short version of the text as an earlier recension of the text. In the frame of this hypothetical suggestion, the majority of the manuscript tradition would preserve an interpolated text, a versio vulgata that might not correspond to Avicenna’s first version of the text. The existence and diffusion of two different recensions of the work might provide a clue of the compositional and editorial process that Avicenna’s Book of the Cure underwent.","Di Vincenzo, Silvia",56790157000
,5,"The present paper deals with Avicenna's critical analysis of the third definition of 'common accident' that Porphyry provides in the Isagoge. The starting point for the present inquiry is chapter I.14 of Avicenna' reworking of Porphyry's Isagoge (Kitāb al-Madhal) in the Book of the Cure (of which an English translation is provided in Appendix A). Firstly, Avicenna's refutation of Porphyry's definition of common accident (PORPH., Isag., 13.4-5 Busse) is examined in section I. Secondly, in section II the core doctrinal issue at stake in Avicenna's refutation of that definition is presented, namely his distinction between the ontological accident (i.e. the accident) and the logical accident (i.e. the accidental). By way of conclusion, it will be argued that Avicenna's reworking of the notion of 'accident' reveals, at the same time, awareness of the preceding and contemporary exegetical tradition, and a conscious detachment from it on the basis of an independent interpretation of Aristotle's Categories.","Di Vincenzo, Silvia",56790157000
,11,"The paper deals with Avicenna's polemical attitude towards the traditional definition of differentia specifica as predicated of many items differing in species in the 'what sort of thing is it ?' that can be found in Porphyry's Isagoge. Two places of the reworking of Porphyry's Isagoge (Madhal) at the beginning of Avicenna's summa entitled Kitab al-Šifa' will be mainly considered : The original account of differentia in chap. I, 13 ; and the rejection of Porphyry's distinction between genus and differentia in chap. II, 1. By comparing these passages of Madhal to other sections of the Šifa', it will be possible to reconstruct in a comprehensive way Avicenna's refutation of the traditional account of differentia, in order to explain his preference for alternative definitions of this predicable in his other logical works. The exegetical problems posed by Porphyry's definition of differentia, and the Greek and Arabic commentators' ensuing discussions, provide the context in which Avicenna elaborates his refutation. Against this background, it will be argued that Avicenna is carrying out a refutation of the account of differentia first advanced by Porphyry and later adopted by the contemporary Peripatetic commentators active in Baghdad, in his effort to achieve a consistent interpretation of Aristotle's claims on differentia.","Di Vincenzo, Silvia",56790157000
10.1163/18778372-00402009,5,"The Latin translation of Avicenna's Madkhal, preserved in thirteen miscellaneous codices and in the edition printed in Venice in 1508, still needs a critical edition. Ideally, this kind of editorial work requires a stemmatic reconstruction of the relations existing between the manuscripts. As a contribution towards this goal, in the first part of this article a provisional classification of the testimonia is offered, although not based on a complete collation of the codices, as a preliminary step towards a future stemmatic arrangement of the entire manuscript tradition. The prospected critical edition will have to provide an accurate explanation of those phenomena characterising the translation process, some examples of which are shown in the second part of this article.","Di Vincenzo, Silvia",56790157000

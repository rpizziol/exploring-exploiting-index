10.1038/s41598-023-46184-y,0,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are complex medical conditions in which the gut microbiota is attacked by the immune system of genetically predisposed subjects when exposed to yet unclear environmental factors. The complexity of this class of diseases makes them suitable to be represented and studied with network science. In this paper, the metagenomic data of control, Crohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis subjects’ gut microbiota were investigated by representing this data as correlation networks and co-expression networks. We obtained correlation networks by calculating Pearson’s correlation between gene expression across subjects. A percolation-based procedure was used to threshold and binarize the adjacency matrices. In contrast, co-expression networks involved the construction of the bipartite subjects-genes networks and the monopartite genes-genes projection after binarization of the biadjacency matrix. Centrality measures and community detection were used on the so-built networks to mine data complexity and highlight possible biomarkers of the diseases. The main results were about the modules of Bacteroides, which were connected in the control subjects’ correlation network, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, where co-enzyme A became central in IBD correlation networks and Escherichia coli, whose module has different patterns of integration within the whole network in the different diagnoses.","Hu, Mirko;Caldarelli, Guido;Gili, Tommaso",57848335900;55139905100;13310221100
10.1038/s41598-023-34998-9,0,"Narratives are paradigmatic examples of natural language, where nouns represent a proxy of information. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies revealed the recruitment of temporal cortices during noun processing and the existence of a noun-specific network at rest. Yet, it is unclear whether, in narratives, changes in noun density influence the brain functional connectivity, so that the coupling between regions correlates with information load. We acquired fMRI activity in healthy individuals listening to a narrative with noun density changing over time and measured whole-network and node-specific degree and betweenness centrality. Network measures were correlated with information magnitude with a time-varying approach. Noun density correlated positively with the across-regions average number of connections and negatively with the average betweenness centrality, suggesting the pruning of peripheral connections as information decreased. Locally, the degree of the bilateral anterior superior temporal sulcus (aSTS) was positively associated with nouns. Importantly, aSTS connectivity cannot be explained by changes in other parts of speech (e.g., verbs) or syllable density. Our results indicate that the brain recalibrates its global connectivity as a function of the information conveyed by nouns in natural language. Also, using naturalistic stimulation and network metrics, we corroborate the role of aSTS in noun processing.","Mastrandrea, Rossana;Cecchetti, Luca;Lettieri, Giada;Handjaras, Giacomo;Leo, Andrea;Papale, Paolo;Gili, Tommaso;Martini, Nicola;Latta, Daniele Della;Chiappino, Dante;Pietrini, Pietro;Ricciardi, Emiliano",56150284600;56625136900;56680972900;35748302500;55311312500;57190440455;13310221100;23025355600;6507141723;8446507300;7005057128;8565770200
10.1103/PhysRevE.108.024313,0,"We present a comparison between various algorithms of inference of covariance and precision matrices in small data sets of real vectors of the typical length and dimension of human brain activity time series retrieved by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Assuming a Gaussian model underlying the neural activity, the problem consists of denoising the empirically observed matrices to obtain a better estimator of the (unknown) true precision and covariance matrices. We consider several standard noise-cleaning algorithms and compare them on two types of data sets. The first type consists of synthetic time series sampled from a generative Gaussian model of which we can vary the fraction of dimensions per sample q and the strength of off-diagonal correlations. The second type consists of time series of fMRI brain activity of human subjects at rest. The reliability of each algorithm is assessed in terms of test-set likelihood and, in the case of synthetic data, of the distance from the true precision matrix. We observe that the so-called optimal rotationally invariant estimator, based on random matrix theory, leads to a significantly lower distance from the true precision matrix in synthetic data and higher test likelihood in natural fMRI data. We propose a variant of the optimal rotationally invariant estimator in which one of its parameters is optimzed by cross-validation. In the severe undersampling regime (large q) typical of fMRI series, it outperforms all the other estimators. We furthermore propose a simple algorithm based on an iterative likelihood gradient ascent, leading to very accurate estimations in weakly correlated synthetic data sets.","Ibáñez-Berganza, Miguel;Lucibello, Carlo;Santucci, Francesca;Gili, Tommaso;Gabrielli, Andrea",54974028100;55965462000;57462088800;13310221100;57222737548
10.1038/s41567-022-01866-8,8,"The renormalization group is the cornerstone of the modern theory of universality and phase transitions and it is a powerful tool to scrutinize symmetries and organizational scales in dynamical systems. However, its application to complex networks has proven particularly challenging, owing to correlations between intertwined scales. To date, existing approaches have been based on hidden geometries hypotheses, which rely on the embedding of complex networks into underlying hidden metric spaces. Here we propose a Laplacian renormalization group diffusion-based picture for complex networks, which is able to identify proper spatiotemporal scales in heterogeneous networks. In analogy with real-space renormalization group procedures, we first introduce the concept of Kadanoff supernodes as block nodes across multiple scales, which helps to overcome detrimental small-world effects that are responsible for cross-scale correlations. We then rigorously define the momentum space procedure to progressively integrate out fast diffusion modes and generate coarse-grained graphs. We validate the method through application to several real-world networks, demonstrating its ability to perform network reduction keeping crucial properties of the systems intact.","Villegas, Pablo;Gili, Tommaso;Caldarelli, Guido;Gabrielli, Andrea",56318833100;13310221100;55139905100;57222737548
10.3390/f14020276,3,"In cultural heritage conservation science, moisture content (MC) is an essential factor to determine. At the same time, it is essential to choose non-destructive and non-invasive approaches for more sustainable investigations and make them safe for the environment and the sample. The question addressed in this work concerns the possibility and the opportunity to investigate waterlogged wood by using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) clinical scanners to carry out non-destructive volumetric diagnostics. In this study, MRI, the most important non-invasive medical imaging technique for human tissue analysis, was applied to study archaeological waterlogged wood samples. This type of archaeological material has a very high moisture content (400%–800%), thus, it is an ideal investigative subject for MRI which detects water molecules inside matter. By following this methodology, it was possible to obtain information about water content and conservation status through a T1, T2, and T2* weighted image analysis, without any sampling or handling, and the samples were directly scanned in the water where they were stored. Furthermore, it permited processing 3D reconstruction, which could be an innovative tool for the digitalization of marine archaeological collections. In this work, 16 modern species of wood and a waterlogged archaeological wood sample were studied and investigated using a clinical NMR scanner operating at 3T. The results were compared with X-ray computed tomography (CT) images, as they had already been used for dendrochronology. The comparison highlights the similar, different, and complementary information about moisture content and conservation status in an all-in-one methodology obtainable from both MRI and CT techniques.","Longo, Sveva;Egizi, Federica;Stagno, Valeria;Di Trani, Maria Giovanna;Marchelletta, Gianni;Gili, Tommaso;Fazio, Enza;Favero, Gabriele;Capuani, Silvia",57200257535;57243944800;57216979346;57194221696;58119907200;13310221100;8521942000;7005901618;6602715209
10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.033196,4,"Complex networks usually exhibit a rich architecture organized over multiple intertwined scales. Information pathways are expected to pervade these scales reflecting structural insights that are not manifest from analyses of the network topology. Moreover, small-world effects correlate with the different network hierarchies complicating the identification of coexisting mesoscopic structures and functional cores. We present a communicability analysis of effective information pathways throughout complex networks based on information diffusion to shed further light on these issues. We employ a variety of brand-new theoretical techniques allowing for: (i) bring the theoretical framework to quantify the probability of information diffusion among nodes, (ii) identify critical scales and structures of complex networks regardless of their intrinsic properties, and (iii) demonstrate their dynamical relevance in synchronization phenomena. By combining these ideas, we evidence how the information flow on complex networks unravels different resolution scales. Using computational techniques, we focus on entropic transitions, uncovering a generic mesoscale object, the information core, and controlling information processing in complex networks. Altogether, this study sheds much light on allowing new theoretical techniques paving the way to introduce future renormalization group approaches based on diffusion distances.","Villegas, Pablo;Gabrielli, Andrea;Santucci, Francesca;Caldarelli, Guido;Gili, Tommaso",56318833100;57222737548;57462088800;55139905100;13310221100
10.1088/1742-5468/ac7a2c,1,"A set of discrete individual points located in an embedding continuum space can be seen as percolating or non-percolating, depending on the radius of the discs/spheres associated with each of them. This problem is relevant in theoretical ecology to analyze, e.g., the spatial percolation of a tree species in a tropical forest or a savanna. Here, we revisit the problem of aggregating random points in continuum systems (from 2 to 6-dimensional Euclidean spaces) to analyze the nature of the corresponding percolation transition in spatial point processes. This problem finds a natural description in terms of the canonical ensemble but not in the usual grand-canonical one, customarily employed to describe percolation transitions. This leads us to analyze the question of ensemble equivalence and study whether the resulting canonical continuum percolation transition shares its universal properties with standard percolation transitions, analyzing diverse homogeneous and heterogeneous spatial point processes. We, therefore, provide a powerful tool to characterize and classify a vast class of natural point patterns, revealing their fundamental properties based on percolation phase transitions.","Villegas, Pablo;Gili, Tommaso;Gabrielli, Andrea;Caldarelli, Guido",56318833100;13310221100;57222737548;55139905100
10.3390/jpm12060957,3,"Artificial intelligence (AI) models and procedures hold remarkable predictive efficiency in the medical domain through their ability to discover hidden, non-obvious clinical patterns in data. However, due to the sparsity, noise, and time-dependency of medical data, AI procedures are raising unprecedented issues related to the mismatch between doctors’ mentalreasoning and the statistical answers provided by algorithms. Electronic systems can reproduce or even amplify noise hidden in the data, especially when the diagnosis of the subjects in the training data set is inaccurate or incomplete. In this paper we describe the conditions that need to be met for AI instruments to be truly useful in the orthodontic domain. We report some examples of computational procedures that are capable of extracting orthodontic knowledge through ever deeper patient representation. To have confidence in these procedures, orthodontic practitioners should recognize the benefits, shortcomings, and unintended consequences of AI models, as algorithms that learn from human decisions likewise learn mistakes and biases.","Auconi, Pietro;Gili, Tommaso;Capuani, Silvia;Saccucci, Matteo;Caldarelli, Guido;Polimeni, Antonella;Di Carlo, Gabriele",56452990800;13310221100;6602715209;55902737600;55139905100;55018305300;56351050400

10.1038/s41598-021-94825-x,5,"Network neuroscience shed some light on the functional and structural modifications occurring to the brain associated with the phenomenology of schizophrenia. In particular, resting-state functional networks have helped our understanding of the illness by highlighting the global and local alterations within the cerebral organization. We investigated the robustness of the brain functional architecture in 44 medicated schizophrenic patients and 40 healthy comparators through an advanced network analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. The networks in patients showed more resistance to disconnection than in healthy controls, with an evident discrepancy between the two groups in the node degree distribution computed along a percolation process. Despite a substantial similarity of the basal functional organization between the two groups, the expected hierarchy of healthy brains' modular organization is crumbled in schizophrenia, showing a peculiar arrangement of the functional connections, characterized by several topologically equivalent backbones. Thus, the manifold nature of the functional organization’s basal scheme, together with its altered hierarchical modularity, may be crucial in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. This result fits the disconnection hypothesis that describes schizophrenia as a brain disorder characterized by an abnormal functional integration among brain regions.","Mastrandrea, Rossana;Piras, Fabrizio;Gabrielli, Andrea;Banaj, Nerisa;Caldarelli, Guido;Spalletta, Gianfranco;Gili, Tommaso",56150284600;57576967000;57222737548;56194289200;55139905100;57201126550;13310221100
10.1111/ocr.12490,4,"Objective: The interaction between skeletal class and upper airway has been extensively studied. Nevertheless, this relationship has not been clearly elucidated, with the heterogeneity of results suggesting the existence of different patterns for patients' classification, which has been elusive so far, probably due to oversimplified approaches. Hence, a network analysis was applied to test whether different patterns in patients' grouping exist. Settings and sample population: Ninety young adult patients with no obvious signs of respiratory diseases and no previous adeno-tonsillectomy procedures, with thirty patients characterized as Class I (0 < ANB < 4); 30 Class II (ANB > 4); and 30 as Class III (ANB < 0). Materials and methods: A community detection approach was applied on a graph obtained from a previously analysed sample: thirty-two measurements (nineteen cephalometric and thirteen upper airways data) were considered. Results: An airway-orthodontic complex network has been obtained by cross-correlating patients. Before entering the correlation, data were controlled for age and gender using linear regression and standardized. By including or not the upper airway measurements as independent variables, two different community structures were obtained. Each contained five modules, though with different patients' assignments. Conclusion: The community detection algorithm found the existence of more than the three classical skeletal classifications. These results support the development of alternative tools to classify subjects according to their craniofacial morphology. This approach could offer a powerful tool for implementing novel strategies for clinical and research in orthodontics.","Di Carlo, Gabriele;Gili, Tommaso;Caldarelli, Guido;Polimeni, Antonella;Cattaneo, Paolo M.",56351050400;13310221100;55139905100;55018305300;7005873384
10.1016/j.ebiom.2021.103588,5,"Background: Analyses of few gene-sets in epilepsy showed a potential to unravel key disease associations. We set out to investigate the burden of ultra-rare variants (URVs) in a comprehensive range of biologically informed gene-sets presumed to be implicated in epileptogenesis. Methods: The burden of 12 URV types in 92 gene-sets was compared between cases and controls using whole exome sequencing data from individuals of European descent with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE, n = 1,003), genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE, n = 3,064), or non-acquired focal epilepsy (NAFE, n = 3,522), collected by the Epi25 Collaborative, compared to 3,962 ancestry-matched controls. Findings: Missense URVs in highly constrained regions were enriched in neuron-specific and developmental genes, whereas genes not expressed in brain were not affected. GGE featured a higher burden in gene-sets derived from inhibitory vs. excitatory neurons or associated receptors, whereas the opposite was found for NAFE, and DEE featured a burden in both. Top-ranked susceptibility genes from recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and gene-sets derived from generalized vs. focal epilepsies revealed specific enrichment patterns of URVs in GGE vs. NAFE. Interpretation: Missense URVs affecting highly constrained sites differentially impact genes expressed in inhibitory vs. excitatory pathways in generalized vs. focal epilepsies. The excess of URVs in top-ranked GWAS risk-genes suggests a convergence of rare deleterious and common risk-variants in the pathogenesis of generalized and focal epilepsies.

10.1002/hbm.25332,9,"In-scanner head motion represents a major confounding factor in functional connectivity studies and it raises particular concerns when motion correlates with the effect of interest. One such instance regards research focused on functional connectivity modulations induced by sustained cognitively demanding tasks. Indeed, cognitive engagement is generally associated with substantially lower in-scanner movement compared with unconstrained, or minimally constrained, conditions. Consequently, the reliability of condition-dependent changes in functional connectivity relies on effective denoising strategies. In this study, we evaluated the ability of common denoising pipelines to minimize and balance residual motion-related artifacts between resting-state and task conditions. Denoising pipelines—including realignment/tissue-based regression, PCA/ICA-based methods (aCompCor and ICA-AROMA, respectively), global signal regression, and censoring of motion-contaminated volumes—were evaluated according to a set of benchmarks designed to assess either residual artifacts or network identifiability. We found a marked heterogeneity in pipeline performance, with many approaches showing a differential efficacy between rest and task conditions. The most effective approaches included aCompCor, optimized to increase the noise prediction power of the extracted confounding signals, and global signal regression, although both strategies performed poorly in mitigating the spurious distance-dependent association between motion and connectivity. Censoring was the only approach that substantially reduced distance-dependent artifacts, yet this came at the great cost of reduced network identifiability. The implications of these findings for best practice in denoising task-based functional connectivity data, and more generally for resting-state data, are discussed.","Mascali, Daniele;Moraschi, Marta;DiNuzzo, Mauro;Tommasin, Silvia;Fratini, Michela;Gili, Tommaso;Wise, Richard G.;Mangia, Silvia;Macaluso, Emiliano;Giove, Federico",56585705200;14325441800;35109148000;24167520700;22978766600;13310221100;35394428700;13104118000;6701716382;6603200123

10.3390/brainsci10120969,25,"The effects of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) on functional brain connectivity in healthy adults is missing in the literature. To make up for this lack, we applied advanced network analysis methods to analyze resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, after OMT and Placebo treatment (P) in 30 healthy asymptomatic young participants randomized into OMT and placebo groups (OMTg; Pg). fMRI brain activity measures, performed before (T0), immediately after (T1) and three days after (T2) OMT or P were used for inferring treatment effects on brain circuit functional organization. Repeated measures ANOVA and post-hoc analysis demonstrated that Right Precentral Gyrus (F (2, 32) = 5.995, p < 0.005) was more influential over the information flow immediately after the OMT, while decreased betweenness centrality in Left Caudate (F (2, 32) = 6.496, p < 0.005) was observable three days after. Clustering coefficient showed a distinct time-point and group effect. At T1, reduced neighborhood connectivity was observed after OMT in the Left Amygdala (L-Amyg) (F(2, 32) = 7.269, p < 0.005) and Left Middle Temporal Gyrus (F(2, 32) = 6.452, p < 0.005), whereas at T2 the L-Amyg and Vermis-III (F(2, 32) = 6.772, p < 0.005) increased functional interactions.

10.3390/ijms21228730,61,"Several studies in recent times have linked gut microbiome (GM) diversity to the pathogenesis of cancer and its role in disease progression through immune response, inflammation and metabolism modulation. This study focused on the use of network analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify the biological interaction between the gut ecosystem and its metabolites that could impact the immunotherapy response in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing second-line treatment with anti-PD1. Metabolomic data were merged with operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from 16S RNA-targeted metagenomics and classified by chemometric models. The traits considered for the analyses were: (i) condition: disease or control (CTRLs), and (ii) treatment: responder (R) or non-responder (NR). Network analysis indicated that indole and its derivatives, aldehydes and alcohols could play a signaling role in GM functionality. WGCNA generated, instead, strong correlations between short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and a healthy GM. Furthermore, commensal bacteria such as Akkermansia muciniphila, Rikenellaceae, Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcaceae, Mogibacteriaceae and Clostridiaceae were found to be more abundant in CTRLs than in NSCLC patients. Our preliminary study demonstrates that the discovery of microbiota-linked biomarkers could provide an indication on the road towards personalized management of NSCLC patients.","Vernocchi, Pamela;Gili, Tommaso;Conte, Federica;Del Chierico, Federica;Conta, Giorgia;Miccheli, Alfredo;Botticelli, Andrea;Paci, Paola;Caldarelli, Guido;Nuti, Marianna;Marchetti, Paolo;Putignani, Lorenza",6507812815;13310221100;57193271282;8976163900;57195485464;6701528090;55651223000;36890340300;55139905100;36340680300;56660360600;6603168130
10.1002/hbm.25107,4,"“Sense of agency” (SoA), the feeling of control for events caused by one's own actions, is deceived by visuomotor incongruence. Sensorimotor networks are implicated in SoA, however little evidence exists on brain functionality during agency processing. Concurrently, it has been suggested that the brain's intrinsic resting-state (rs) activity has a preliminary influence on processing of agency cues. Here, we investigated the relation between performance in an agency attribution task and functional interactions among brain regions as derived by network analysis of rs functional magnetic resonance imaging. The action-effect delay was adaptively increased (range 90–1,620 ms) and behavioral measures correlated to indices of cognitive processes and appraised self-concepts. They were then regressed on local metrics of rs brain functional connectivity as to isolate the core areas enabling self-agency. Across subjects, the time window for self-agency was 90–625 ms, while the action-effect integration was impacted by self-evaluated personality traits. Neurally, the brain intrinsic organization sustaining consistency in self-agency attribution was characterized by high connectiveness in the secondary visual cortex, and regional segregation in the primary somatosensory area. Decreased connectiveness in the secondary visual area, regional segregation in the superior parietal lobule, and information control within a primary visual cortex-frontal eye fields network sustained self-agency over long-delayed effects. We thus demonstrate that self-agency is grounded on the intrinsic mode of brain function designed to organize information for visuomotor integration. Our observation is relevant for current models of psychopathology in clinical conditions in which both rs activity and sense of agency are altered.","Piras, Federica;Vecchio, Daniela;Ciullo, Valentina;Gili, Tommaso;Banaj, Nerisa;Piras, Fabrizio;Spalletta, Gianfranco",35746761500;57201026790;56026489000;13310221100;56194289200;57576967000;57201126550
10.1093/brain/awaa171,34,"Cytogenic testing is routinely applied in most neurological centres for severe paediatric epilepsies. However, which characteristics of copy number variants (CNVs) confer most epilepsy risk and which epilepsy subtypes carry the most CNV burden, have not been explored on a genome-wide scale. Here, we present the largest CNV investigation in epilepsy to date with 10 712 European epilepsy cases and 6746 ancestry-matched controls. Patients with genetic generalized epilepsy, lesional focal epilepsy, non-acquired focal epilepsy, and developmental and epileptic encephalopathy were included. All samples were processed with the same technology and analysis pipeline. All investigated epilepsy types, including lesional focal epilepsy patients, showed an increase in CNV burden in at least one tested category compared to controls. However, we observed striking differences in CNV burden across epilepsy types and investigated CNV categories. Genetic generalized epilepsy patients have the highest CNV burden in all categories tested, followed by developmental and epileptic encephalopathy patients. Both epilepsy types also show association for deletions covering genes intolerant for truncating variants. Genome-wide CNV breakpoint association showed not only significant loci for genetic generalized and developmental and epileptic encephalopathy patients but also for lesional focal epilepsy patients. With a 34-fold risk for developing genetic generalized epilepsy, we show for the first time that the established epilepsy-associated 15q13.3 deletion represents the strongest risk CNV for genetic generalized epilepsy across the whole genome. Using the human interactome, we examined the largest connected component of the genes overlapped by CNVs in the four epilepsy types. We observed that genetic generalized epilepsy and non-acquired focal epilepsy formed disease modules. In summary, we show that in all common epilepsy types, 1.5-3% of patients carry epilepsy-associated CNVs. The characteristics of risk CNVs vary tremendously across and within epilepsy types. Thus, we advocate genome-wide genomic testing to identify all disease-associated types of CNVs.","Niestroj, Lisa Marie;Perez-Palma, Eduardo;Howrigan, Daniel P.;Zhou, Yadi;Cheng, Feixiong;Saarentaus, Elmo;Nürnberg, Peter;Stevelink, Remi;Daly, Mark J.;Palotie, Aarno;Lal, Dennis;Feng, Yen Chen Anne;Abbott, Liam E.;Tashman, Katherine;Cerrato, Felecia;Churchhouse, Claire;Gupta, Namrata;Neale, Benjamin M.;Berkovic, Samuel F.;Lerche, Holger;Goldstein, David B.;Lowenstein, Daniel H.;Cavalleri, Gianpiero L.;Cossette, Patrick;Cotsapas, Chris;De Jonghe, Peter;Dixon-Salazar, Tracy;Guerrini, Renzo;Hakonarson, Hakon;Heinzen, Erin L.;Helbig, Ingo;Kwan, Patrick;Marson, Anthony G.;Petrovski, Slavé;Kamalakaran, Sitharthan;Sisodiya, Sanjay M.;Stewart, Randy;Weckhuysen, Sarah;Depondt, Chantal;Dlugos, Dennis J.;Scheffer, Ingrid E.;Striano, Pasquale;Freyer, Catharine;Krause, Roland;May, Patrick;McKenna, Kevin;Regan, Brigid M.;Leu, Costin;Bennett, Caitlin A.;Bellows, Susannah T.;Johns, Esther M.C.;MacDonald, Alexandra;Shilling, Hannah;Burgess, Rosemary;Weckhuysen, Dorien;Bahlo, Melanie;O'Brien, Terence J.;Todaro, Marian;Stamberger, Hannah;Andrade, Danielle M.;Sadoway, Tara R.;Mo, Kelly;Krestel, Heinz;Gallati, Sabina;Papacostas, Savvas S.;Kousiappa, Ioanna;Tanteles, George A.;Šterbová, Katalin;Vlcková, Markéta;Sedlácková, Lucie;Laššuthová, Petra;Martin, Karlklein;Rosenow, Felix;Reif, Philipp S.;Knake, Susanne;Kunz, Wolfram S.;Zsurka, Gábor;Elger, Christian E.;Bauer, Jürgen;Rademacher, Michael;Pendziwiat, Manuela;Muhle, Hiltrud;Rademacher, Annika;Van Baalen, Andreas;Von Spiczak, Sarah;Stephani, Ulrich;Afawi, Zaid;Korczyn, Amos D.;Kanaan, Moien;Canavati, Christina;Kurlemann, Gerhard;Müller-Schlüter, Karen;Kluger, Gerhard;Häusler, Martin;Blatt, Ilan;Lemke, Johannes R.;Krey, Ilona;Weber, Yvonne G.;Wolking, Stefan;Becker, Felicitas",57204352840;55981322300;37101711900;57205439326;36514277000;57195680623;7005697981;57193420934;7201456226;57216039445;57220522727;57208346127;57208584859;57209802869;15135316700;57211727426;36930358000;7003484514;7101763886;57203078114;56999187100;7006815175;7005536415;6602073684;57216599330;20435787800;6507184968;22947165000;55531171800;57210242388;57201570366;7004369601;7006387194;26026629300;28567824000;7005111176;57189629306;57189237862;6506263121;57204027210;7006332397;57226262657;57193856722;57214957340;35345177300;55631259300;55512756500;25936428000;57203692813;35182419600;57192659697;57210190384;57492458800;56998229900;56770023100;57221587451;35518362200;55531365500;56470831500;7004895973;55516240600;57196485402;6507999386;6701430592;55947902300;26021286400;14822532100;6506601585;36446872600;55917097600;24471754100;57207167503;7004179118;23976383500;6601946873;24474610300;6506311186;55945760400;55572073800;8258949800;35741507900;8636730300;57209074372;13103258400;57199841067;57202569902;16308953900;7202925574;6603865886;57208921011;35561130100;57203036454;55812600900;24576600200;7003371091;57192423821;57191334716;57879086000;26658828800;57193218922
10.3389/fphys.2020.00422,5,"Spontaneous oscillations of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal are spatially synchronized within specific brain networks and are thought to reflect synchronized brain activity. Networks are modulated by the performance of a task, even if the exact features and degree of such modulations are still elusive. The presence of networks showing anticorrelated fluctuations lend initially to suppose that a competitive relationship between the default mode network (DMN) and task positive networks (TPNs) supports the efficiency of brain processing. However, more recent results indicate that cooperative and competitive dynamics between networks coexist during task performance. In this study, we used graph analysis to assess the functional relevance of the topological reorganization of brain networks ensuing the execution of a steady state working-memory (WM) task. Our results indicate that the performance of an auditory WM task is associated with a switching between different topological configurations of several regions of specific networks, including frontoparietal, ventral attention, and dorsal attention areas, suggesting segregation of ventral attention regions in the presence of increased overall integration. However, the correct execution of the task requires integration between components belonging to all the involved networks.","Moraschi, Marta;Mascali, Daniele;Tommasin, Silvia;Gili, Tommaso;Hassan, Ibrahim Eid;Fratini, Michela;DiNuzzo, Mauro;Wise, Richard G.;Mangia, Silvia;Macaluso, Emiliano;Giove, Federico",14325441800;56585705200;24167520700;13310221100;35185890500;22978766600;35109148000;35394428700;13104118000;6701716382;6603200123
10.1016/j.brainres.2019.146564,7,"It has long been assumed that the language function is hierarchically organized into specific cortical areas. Here, for the first time, we present direct evidence that the spinal cord takes part in language processing. In a randomized-double blind design, sixteen aphasics underwent a language treatment combined with transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS). During the treatment, each subject received tsDCS (20 min, 2 mA) over the thoracic vertebrae (IX-X vertebrae) in two different conditions: (1) anodal, and (2) sham while performing a verb naming task. Each experimental condition was run in five consecutive daily sessions over two weeks. Before and after each condition, all patients underwent a resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). After anodal tsDCS, significant functional connectivity changes were found in a cerebellar-cortical network recruiting regions such as the left cerebellum, the right parietal and premotor cortex known to be also involved in action-related verb processing. Indeed, this increase of connectivity significantly correlated with the greatest amount of improvement found in verb naming. In line with our experimental data, we also found a greater improvement after anodal tsDCS also on untreated items of the language test but only on tasks which required the use of verbs, such as verb naming and picture description. No significant changes were found in noun naming. Thus, this evidence emphasizes, for the first time, that the neural response due to tsDCS combined with language treatment changes during the course of recovery by enhancing activity into cortical regions which influence verb processing.","Marangolo, Paola;Fiori, Valentina;Caltagirone, Carlo;Incoccia, Chiara;Gili, Tommaso",6603706176;44760908400;35228717800;6602459966;13310221100
10.3389/fphys.2019.01541,9,"Mechanisms of anesthetic drug-induced sedation and unconsciousness are still incompletely understood. Functional neuroimaging modalities provide a window to study brain function changes during anesthesia allowing us to explore the sequence of neuro-physiological changes associated with anesthesia. Cerebral perfusion change under an assumption of intact neurovascular coupling is an indicator of change in large-scale neural activity. In this experiment, we have investigated resting state cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes in the human brain during mild sedation, with propofol. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) provides a non-invasive, reliable, and robust means of measuring cerebral blood flow (CBF) and can therefore be used to investigate central drug effects. Mild propofol sedation-related CBF changes were studied at rest (n = 15), in a 3 T MR scanner using a PICORE-QUIPSS II ASL technique. CBF was reduced in bilateral paracingulate cortex, premotor cortex, Broca’s areas, right superior frontal gyrus and also the thalamus. This cerebral perfusion study demonstrates that propofol induces suppression of key cortical (frontal lobe) and subcortical (thalamus) regions during mild sedation.","Saxena, Neeraj;Gili, Tommaso;Diukova, Ana;Huckle, Danielle;Hall, Judith E.;Wise, Richard G.",36459102300;13310221100;36466398000;55889570800;20433306100;35394428700
10.1093/brain/awz292,83,"Rare genetic variants can cause epilepsy, and genetic testing has been widely adopted for severe, paediatric-onset epilepsies. The phenotypic consequences of common genetic risk burden for epilepsies and their potential future clinical applications have not yet been determined. Using polygenic risk scores (PRS) from a European-ancestry genome-wide association study in generalized and focal epilepsy, we quantified common genetic burden in patients with generalized epilepsy (GE-PRS) or focal epilepsy (FE-PRS) from two independent non-Finnish European cohorts (Epi25 Consortium, n = 5705; Cleveland Clinic Epilepsy Center, n = 620; both compared to 20 435 controls). One Finnish-ancestry population isolate (Finnish-ancestry Epi25, n = 449; compared to 1559 controls), two European-ancestry biobanks (UK Biobank, n = 383 656; Vanderbilt biorepository, n = 49 494), and one Japaneseancestry biobank (BioBank Japan, n = 168 680) were used for additional replications. Across 8386 patients with epilepsy and 622 212 population controls, we found and replicated significantly higher GE-PRS in patients with generalized epilepsy of European-ancestry compared to patients with focal epilepsy (Epi25: P = 1.64×10-15; Cleveland: P = 2.85×10-4; Finnish-ancestry Epi25: P = 1.80×10-4) or population controls (Epi25: P = 2.35×10-70; Cleveland: P = 1.43×10-7; Finnish-ancestry Epi25: P = 3.11×10-4; UK Biobank and Vanderbilt biorepository meta-analysis: P = 7.99×10-4). FE-PRS were significantly higher in patients with focal epilepsy compared to controls in the non-Finnish, non-biobank cohorts (Epi25: P = 5.74×10-19; Cleveland: P = 1.69×10-6). European ancestry-derived PRS did not predict generalized epilepsy or focal epilepsy in Japanese-ancestry individuals. Finally, we observed a significant 4.6-fold and a 4.5-fold enrichment of patients with generalized epilepsy compared to controls in the top 0.5% highest GE-PRS of the two non-Finnish European cohorts (Epi25: P = 2.60×10-15; Cleveland: P = 1.39×10-2). We conclude that common variant risk associated with epilepsy is significantly enriched in multiple cohorts of patients with epilepsy compared to controls-in particular for generalized epilepsy. As sample sizes and PRS accuracy continue to increase with further common variant discovery, PRS could complement established clinical biomarkers and augment genetic testing for patient classification, comorbidity research, and potentially targeted treatment.","Leu, Costin;Stevelink, Remi;Smith, Alexander W.;Goleva, Slavina B.;Kanai, Masahiro;Ferguson, Lisa;Campbell, Ciaran;Kamatani, Yoichiro;Okada, Yukinori;Sisodiya, Sanjay M.;Cavalleri, Gianpiero L.;Koeleman, Bobby P.C.;Lerche, Holger;Jehi, Lara;Davis, Lea K.;Najm, Imad M.;Palotie, Aarno;Daly, Mark J.;Busch, Robyn M.;Lal, Dennis;Feng, Yen Chen Anne;Howrigan, Daniel P.;Abbott, Liam E.;Tashman, Katherine;Cerrato, Felecia;Churchhouse, Claire;Gupta, Namrata;Neale, Benjamin M.;Berkovic, Samuel F.;Goldstein, David B.;Lowenstein, Daniel H.;Cossette, Patrick;Cotsapas, Chris;De Jonghe, Peter;Dixon-Salazar, Tracy;Guerrini, Renzo;Hakonarson, Hakon;Heinzen, Erin L.;Helbig, Ingo;Kwan, Patrick;Marson, Anthony G.;Petrovski, Slavé;Kamalakaran, Sitharthan;Stewart, Randy;Weckhuysen, Sarah;Depondt, Chantal;Dlugos, Dennis J.;Scheffer, Ingrid E.;Striano, Pasquale;Freyer, Catharine;Krause, Roland;May, Patrick;McKenna, Kevin;Regan, Brigid M.;Bellows, Susannah T.;Bennett, Caitlin A.;Johns, Esther M.C.;Macdonald, Alexandra;Shilling, Hannah;Burgess, Rosemary;Weckhuysen, Dorien;Bahlo, Melanie;O'Brien, Terence J.;Todaro, Marian;Stamberger, Hannah;Andrade, Danielle M.;Sadoway, Tara R.;Mo, Kelly;Krestel, Heinz;Gallati, Sabina;Papacostas, Savvas S.;Kousiappa, Ioanna;Tanteles, George A.;Šterbová, Katalin;Vlcková, Markéta;Sedlácková, Lucie;Laššuthová, Petra;Klein, Karl Martin;Rosenow, Felix;Reif, Philipp S.;Knake, Susanne;Kunz, Wolfram S.;Zsurka, Gábor;Elger, Christian E.;Bauer, Jürgen;Rademacher, Michael;Pendziwiat, Manuela;Muhle, Hiltrud;Rademacher, Annika;Van Baalen, Andreas;Von Spiczak, Sarah;Stephani, Ulrich;Afawi, Zaid;Korczyn, Amos D.;Kanaan, Moien;Canavati, Christina;Kurlemann, Gerhard;Müller-Schlüter, Karen;Kluger, Gerhard;Häusler, Martin",25936428000;57193420934;57211527457;57195715449;56666893900;55800462200;55464277700;23018337900;7005443464;7005111176;7005536415;57216598807;57203078114;24066873100;57203425292;7005207478;7005614368;7201456226;8317363400;57220522727;57208346127;37101711900;57208584859;57209802869;15135316700;57211727426;36930358000;7003484514;7101763886;56999187100;7006815175;6602073684;57216599330;20435787800;6507184968;22947165000;55531171800;57210242388;57201570366;7004369601;7006387194;26026629300;28567824000;57189629306;57189237862;6506263121;57204027210;7006332397;57226262657;57193856722;57214957340;35345177300;55631259300;55512756500;35182419600;57203692813;57192659697;57210190384;57492458800;56998229900;56770023100;57221587451;35518362200;55531365500;56470831500;7004895973;55516240600;57196485402;6507999386;6701430592;55947902300;26021286400;14822532100;6506601585;36446872600;55917097600;24471754100;8045010800;7004179118;23976383500;6601946873;24474610300;6506311186;55945760400;55572073800;8258949800;35741507900;8636730300;57209074372;13103258400;57199841067;57202569902;16308953900;7202925574;6603865886;57208921011;35561130100;57203036454;55812600900;24576600200

To identify the shared and distinct ultra-rare genetic risk factors for different types of epilepsies, we performed a whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis of 9,170 epilepsy-affected individuals and 8,436 controls of European ancestry. We focused on three phenotypic groups: severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE), and non-acquired focal epilepsy (NAFE). We observed that compared to controls, individuals with any type of epilepsy carried an excess of ultra-rare, deleterious variants in constrained genes and in genes previously associated with epilepsy; we saw the strongest enrichment in individuals with DEEs and the least strong in individuals with NAFE. Moreover, we found that inhibitory GABAA receptor genes were enriched for missense variants across all three classes of epilepsy, whereas no enrichment was seen in excitatory receptor genes. The larger gene groups for the GABAergic pathway or cation channels also showed a significant mutational burden in DEEs and GGE. Although no single gene surpassed exome-wide significance among individuals with GGE or NAFE, highly constrained genes and genes encoding ion channels were among the lead associations; such genes included CACNA1G, EEF1A2, and GABRG2 for GGE and LGI1, TRIM3, and GABRG2 for NAFE. Our study, the largest epilepsy WES study to date, confirms a convergence in the genetics of severe and less-severe epilepsies associated with ultra-rare coding variation, and it highlights a ubiquitous role for GABAergic inhibition in epilepsy etiology.","Feng, Yen Chen Anne;Howrigan, Daniel P.;Abbott, Liam E.;Tashman, Katherine;Cerrato, Felecia;Singh, Tarjinder;Heyne, Henrike;Byrnes, Andrea;Churchhouse, Claire;Watts, Nick;Solomonson, Matthew;Lal, Dennis;Heinzen, Erin L.;Dhindsa, Ryan S.;Stanley, Kate E.;Cavalleri, Gianpiero L.;Hakonarson, H.;Helbig, Ingo;Krause, Roland;May, Patrick;Weckhuysen, S.;Petrovski, Slavé;Kamalakaran, Sitharthan;Sisodiya, Sanjay M.;Cossette, Patrick;Cotsapas, C.;De Jonghe, P.;Dixon-Salazar, T.;Guerrini, R.;Kwan, Patrick;Marson, Anthony G.;Stewart, R.;Depondt, Chantal;Dlugos, Dennis J.;Scheffer, Ingrid E.;Striano, Pasquale;Freyer, Catharine;McKenna, K.;Regan, Brigid M.;Bellows, Susannah T.;Leu, Costin;Bennett, Caitlin A.;Johns, Esther M.C.;Macdonald, Alexandra;Shilling, Hannah;Burgess, Rosemary;Weckhuysen, Dorien;Bahlo, Melanie;O'Brien, Terence J.;Todaro, Marian;Stamberger, Hannah;Andrade, Danielle M.;Sadoway, Tara R.;Mo, K.;Krestel, H.;Gallati, Sabina;Papacostas, Savvas S.;Kousiappa, Ioanna;Tanteles, George A.;Štěrbová, Katalin;Vlčková, Markéta;Sedláčková, L.;Laššuthová, P.;Klein, Karl Martin;Rosenow, F.;Reif, Philipp S.;Knake, Susanne;Kunz, Wolfram S.;Zsurka, Gábor;Elger, Christian E.;Bauer, Jürgen;Rademacher, Michael;Pendziwiat, Manuela;Muhle, Hiltrud;Rademacher, Annika;van Baalen, Andreas;von Spiczak, S.;Stephani, Ulrich;Afawi, Zaid;Korczyn, Amos D.;Kanaan, M.;Canavati, Christina;Kurlemann, Gerhard;Müller-Schlüter, K.;Kluger, Gerhard;Häusler, Martin;Blatt, Ilan;Lemke, Johannes R.;Krey, I.;Weber, Yvonne G.;Wolking, Stefan;Becker, Felicitas;Hengsbach, Christian;Rau, S.;Maisch, A.

Despite evidence of OMT effectiveness, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms, as well as blood perfusion effects, are still poorly understood. The study aim was to address OMT effects on cerebral blood flow (CBF) in asymptomatic young volunteers as measured by Magnetic Resonance Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) method. Thirty blinded participants were randomized to OMT or placebo, and evaluated with an MRI protocol before manual intervention (T0), immediately after (T1), and 3 days later (T2). After T0 MRI, participants received 45 min of OMT, focused on correcting whole body somatic dysfunctions, or placebo manual treatment, consisting of passive touches in a protocolled order. After treatment, participants completed a de-blinding questionnaire about treatment perception. Results show significant differences due to treatment only for the OMT group (OMTg): perfusion decreased (compared to T0) in a cluster comprising the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the superior parietal lobule, while increased at T2 in the contralateral PCC. Furthermore, more than 60% of participants believed they had undergone OMT.

This network behaviour is known to persist also during task execution, yet the details underlying task-associated modulations of within- and between-network connectivity are largely unknown. In this study we exploited a multi-parametric and multi-scale approach to investigate how low-frequency fluctuations adapt to a sustained n-back working memory task. We found that the transition from the resting state to the task state involves a behaviourally relevant and scale-invariant modulation of synchronization patterns within both task-positive and default mode networks. Specifically, decreases of connectivity within networks are accompanied by increases of connectivity between networks. In spite of large and widespread changes of connectivity strength, the overall topology of brain networks is remarkably preserved. We show that these findings are strongly influenced by connectivity at rest, suggesting that the absolute change of connectivity (i.e., disregarding the baseline) may not be the most suitable metric to study dynamic modulations of functional connectivity. Our results indicate that a task can evoke scale-invariant, distributed changes of BOLD fluctuations, further confirming that low frequency BOLD oscillations show a specialized response and are tightly bound to task-evoked activation.","Tommasin, Silvia;Mascali, Daniele;Moraschi, Marta;Gili, Tommaso;Hassan, Ibrahim Eid;Fratini, Michela;DiNuzzo, Mauro;Wise, Richard G.;Mangia, Silvia;Macaluso, Emiliano;Giove, Federico",24167520700;56585705200;14325441800;13310221100;35185890500;22978766600;35109148000;35394428700;13104118000;6701716382;6603200123

As a result, the human brain is able to process temporal information and generate temporal patterns. Despite the clear importance of temporal processing to cognition, learning, communication and sensory, motor and emotional processing, the basal mechanisms of how animals differentiate simple intervals or provide timed responses are still under debate. The lesson we learned from the last decade of research in neuroscience is that functional and structural brain connectivity matter. Specifically, it has been accepted that the organization of the brain in interacting segregated networks enables its function. In this paper we delineate the route to a promising approach for investigating timing mechanisms. We illustrate how novel insight into timing mechanisms can come by investigating brain functioning as a multi-layer dynamical network whose clustered dynamics is bound to report the presence of metastable states. We anticipate that metastable dynamics underlie the real-time coordination necessary for the brain’s dynamic functioning associated to time perception. This new point of view will help further clarifying mechanisms of neuropsychiatric disorders.","Gili, Tommaso;Ciullo, Valentina;Spalletta, Gianfranco",13310221100;56026489000;57201126550

However, the existence of specialized neural networks for inferring predictive relationships between events is still debated. Using graph theoretical analysis applied to structural connectivity data, we tested the extent of brain connectivity properties associated with spatio-temporal predictive performance across 29 healthy subjects. Participants detected visual targets appearing at one out of three locations after one out of three intervals; expectations about stimulus location (spatial condition) or onset (temporal condition) were induced by valid or invalid symbolic cues. Connectivity matrices and centrality/segregation measures, expressing the relative importance of, and the local interactions among specific cerebral areas respect to the behavior under investigation, were calculated from whole-brain tractography and cortico-subcortical parcellation. Results: Response preparedness to cued stimuli relied on different structural connectivity networks for the temporal and spatial domains. Significant covariance was observed between centrality measures of regions within a subcortical-fronto-parietal-occipital network -comprising the left putamen, the right caudate nucleus, the left frontal operculum, the right inferior parietal cortex, the right paracentral lobule and the right superior occipital cortex-, and the ability to respond after a short cue-target delay suggesting that the local connectedness of such nodes plays a central role when the source of temporal expectation is explicit. When the potential for functional segregation was tested, we found highly clustered structural connectivity across the right superior, the left middle inferior frontal gyrus and the left caudate nucleus as related to explicit temporal orienting. Conversely, when the interaction between explicit and implicit temporal orienting processes was considered at the long interval, we found that explicit processes were related to centrality measures of the bilateral inferior parietal lobule. Degree centrality of the same region in the left hemisphere covaried with behavioral measures indexing the process of attentional re-orienting. These results represent a crucial step forward the ordinary predictive processing description, as we identified the patterns of connectivity characterizing the brain organization associated with the ability to generate and update temporal expectancies in case of contextual violations.","Ciullo, Valentina;Vecchio, Daniela;Gili, Tommaso;Spalletta, Gianfranco;Piras, Federica",56026489000;57201026790;13310221100;57201126550;35746761500

These techniques helped clarify in vivo some of the principal neurobiological characteristic of the quintessential major mental disorder, schizophrenia, providing evidence for potential biomarkers that might improve the diagnostic process, therapeutic monitoring, and outcomes. Here, we describe the main brain morphometric techniques (including volumetric, shape analysis, and microstructural techniques) currently used in research on schizophrenia and summarize the results of the most important studies in the field. This chapter aims at providing an exhaustive description of the state-of-the-art in vivo brain morphology in schizophrenia in order to better characterize the disorder from a neurobiological point of view, thus providing a comprehensive background for further research on this topic. A general picture emerges in which schizophrenia is characterized by widespread brain cortical and subcortical, structural, and microstructural anomalies since the early phases of the course of illness. Volumetric, shape, and microstructural disruptions in structures of the fronto-temporo-parietal network are predominant both cross-sectionally and in terms of altered developmental trajectories and outcome prediction. Future studies on brain morphometric indices in schizophrenia should focus on their reliability as predictors of treatment response through longitudinal designs in large samples.","Chiapponi, Chiara;De Rossi, Pietro;Piras, Fabrizio;Gili, Tommaso;Spalletta, Gianfranco",56634680600;57209769152;55274309000;13310221100;7004157010

Complex network theory allows to elicit the functional architecture of the brain in terms of links (correlations) between nodes (grey matter regions) and to extract information out of the noise. Here we present the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data from forty healthy humans at rest for the investigation of the basal scaffold of the functional brain network organization. We show how brain regions tend to coordinate by forming a highly hierarchical chain-like structure of homogeneously clustered anatomical areas. A maximum spanning tree approach revealed the centrality of the occipital cortex and the peculiar aggregation of cerebellar regions to form a closed core.

10.1007/s11682-016-9635-1,25,"Recent studies have shown that the systematic and repetitive observation of actions belonging to the experiential human motor repertoire without verbal facilitation enhances the recovery of verbs in non fluent aphasia. However, it is still an open question whether this approach extends its efficacy also on discourse productivity by improving the retrieval of other linguistic units (i.e. nouns, sentences, content words). Moreover, nothing is known regarding the neural substrates which support the language recovery process due to action observation treatment.In the present study, ten non fluent aphasics were presented with two videoclips (real everyday life context vs. familiar pantomimed context), each video for six consecutive weeks (Monday to Friday, weekend off). During the treatment, they were asked to observe each video and to describe it without verbal facilitation from the therapist. In all patients, language measures were collected before and at the end of treatment. Before and after each treatment condition (real vs. pantomimed context), each subject underwent a resting state fMRI. After the treatment, significant changes in functional connectivity were found in right sensory-motor networks which were accompanied by a significant improvement for the different linguistic units in the real context condition. On the contrary, the language recovery obtained in the pantomimed context did not match any functional modification. The evidence for a recruitment of the sensory-motor cortices during the observation of actions embedded in real context suggests to potentially enhance language recovery in non fluent aphasia through a simulation process related to the sensory-motor properties of actions.","Gili, Tommaso;Fiori, Valentina;De Pasquale, Giada;Sabatini, Umberto;Caltagirone, Carlo;Marangolo, Paola",13310221100;44760908400;57188737792;7003704731;35228717800;6603706176
10.3389/fneur.2017.00400,20,"Over the last 20 years, major advances in cognitive neuroscience have clearly shown that the language function is not restricted into the classical language areas but it involves brain regions, which had never previously considered. Indeed, recent lines of evidence have suggested that the processing of words associated to motor schemata, such as action verbs, modulates the activity of the sensorimotor cortex, which, in turn, facilitates its retrieval. To date, no studies have investigated whether the spinal cord, which is functionally connected to the sensorimotor system, might also work as an auxiliary support for language processing. We explored the combined effect of transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) and language treatment in a randomized double-blind design for the recovery of verbs and nouns in 14 chronic aphasics. During each treatment, each subject received tsDCS (20 min, 2 mA) over the thoracic vertebrae (10th vertebra) in three different conditions: (1) anodic, (2) cathodic and (3) sham, while performing a verb and noun naming tasks. Each experimental condition was run in five consecutive daily sessions over 3 weeks. Overall, a significant greater improvement in verb naming was found during the anodic condition with respect to the other two conditions, which persisted at 1 week after the end of the treatment. No significant differences were present for noun naming among the three conditions. The hypothesis is advanced that anodic tsDCS might have influenced activity along the ascending somatosensory pathways, ultimately eliciting neurophysiological changes into the sensorimotor areas which, in turn, supported the retrieval of verbs. These results further support the evidence that action words, due to their sensorimotor semantic properties, are partly represented into the sensorimotor cortex. Moreover, they also document, for the first time, that tsDCS enhances verb recovery in chronic aphasia and it may represent a promising new tool for language treatment.","Marangolo, Paola;Fiori, Valentina;Shofany, Jacob;Gili, Tommaso;Caltagirone, Carlo;Cucuzza, Gabriella;Priori, Alberto",6603706176;44760908400;56062717600;13310221100;35228717800;57192892423;7004986496

In this work we sought to examine in a group of 20 healthy volunteers (age 33 ± 6 years, 8 F/12 M) the relationship between changes of spectral and spatiotemporal features of one prominent resting-state network, namely the DMN, during the continuous execution of a working memory n-back task. We found that task execution impacted on both functional connectivity and amplitude of BOLD fluctuations within large parts of the DMN, but these changes correlated between each other only in a small area of the posterior cingulate.

In this study, we assessed effects on resting state brain activity in a group of healthy elderly subjects undergoing acute administration of modafinil, a wakefulness-promoting agent. To that aim, participants (n = 24) were investigated with resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) before and after the administration of a single dose (100 mg) of modafinil. Effects were compared to age and size-matched placebo group. Rs-fMRI effects were assessed, employing a graph-based approach and Eigenvector Centrality (EC) analysis, by taking in account topological changes occurring in functional brain networks. The main finding of the study is that modafinil promotes enhanced centrality, a measure of the importance of nodes within functional networks, of the bilateral primary visual (V1) cortex. EC analysis also revealed that modafinil-treated subjects show increased functional connectivity between the V1 and specific cerebellar (Crus I, Crus II, VIIIa lobule) and frontal (right inferior frontal sulcus and left middle frontal gyrus) regions.

Results showed that, after real stimulation, patients exhibited the greatest recovery not only in terms of better accuracy in articulating the treated stimuli but also for untreated items on different tasks of the language test. Moreover, although after the sham condition connectivity changes were confined to the right brain hemisphere, real stimulation yielded to stronger functional connectivity increase in the left hemisphere.

Several issues may physically impede execution of MRI. Moreover, the severity of motor or non-motor symptoms of PD might reduce compliance to MRI. Here we investigated predictors affecting compliance to MRI in PD patients. Methods: Two-hundred-thirty-six PD patients underwent clinical, neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric investigations. Accordingly to their ability/inability to perform MRI scan, they were divided into 3 groups. Forty-two patients had physical incompatibility to MRI (PI); 51 patients refused to undergo scan during the MRI evaluation session (RR); 143 patients accepted to undergo and successfully completed MRI (SP). Multivariate/Univariate Analyses of Variance, followed by Bonferroni's post-hoc comparisons, were used to assess differences among groups. To identify predictors of compliance to MRI scan in the whole PD sample (SP vs. RR+PI) we carried out a logistic regression analysis. Results: PI subjects were significantly older, had higher UPRDRS-III score, received lower daily dopamine agonist doses, and displayed worse cognitive performances than SP. RR subjects had significantly higher anxiety severity than SP. Lower daily dopamine agonist equivalents and higher anxiety scores were the significant whole predictors of not compliance to MRI in the logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: These results show that demographic, neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric features may limit compliance to MRI in PD, and provide valuable aid for setting and interpreting research and clinical MRI studies in PD.","Cacciari, Claudia;Pellicano, Clelia;Cravello, Luca;Assogna, Francesca;Piras, Fabrizio;Paravia, Patrizia;Gili, Tommaso;Iorio, Mariangela;Stefani, Alessandro;Pierantozzi, Mariangela;Caltagirone, Carlo;Pontieri, Francesco E.;Spalletta, Gianfranco",35309581900;8892791500;7005513919;24528556300;55274309000;56656540500;13310221100;55273700100;7005314660;7004208388;35228717800;7003479146;7004157010

In spite of the increasing use of these measures, whether and how they are related to each other remains to be elucidated. In this work we used voxel-wise FC and ALFF computed in different frequency bands (slow-5:0.01-0.027 Hz; slow-4:0.027-0.073 Hz; and full-band: 0.01-0.073 Hz), in order to assess their relationship in healthy elderly as well as the relevant changes induced by Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). We found that in healthy elderly subjects FC and ALFF are positively correlated in anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (full-band, slow-4 and slow-5), temporal cortex (full-band and slow-5), and in a set of subcortical regions (full-band and slow-4). These correlation patterns between FC and ALFF were absent in either AD or MCI patients. Notably, the loss of correlation between FC and ALFF in the AD group was primarily due to changes in FC rather than in ALFF. Our results indicate that degenerative dementia is characterized by a loss of global connection rather than by a decrease of fluctuation amplitude.","Mascali, Daniele;Dinuzzo, Mauro;Gili, Tommaso;Moraschi, Marta;Fratini, Michela;Maraviglia, Bruno;Serra, Laura;Bozzali, Marco;Giove, Federico",56585705200;35109148000;13310221100;14325441800;22978766600;7005434101;8266381200;6701548417;6603200123
10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3480-12.2013,69,"Despite their routine use during surgical procedures, no consensus has yet been reached on the precise mechanisms by which hypnotic anesthetic agents produce their effects. Molecular, animal and human studies have suggested disruption of thalamocortical communication as a key component of anesthetic action at the brain systems level. Here, we used the anesthetic agent, propofol, to modulate consciousness and to evaluate differences in the interactions of remote neural networks during altered consciousness. We investigated the effects of propofol, at a dose that produced mild sedation without loss of consciousness, on spontaneous cerebral activity of 15 healthy volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), exploiting oscillations (<0.1 Hz) in blood oxygenation level-dependent signal across functionally connected brain regions. We considered the data as a graph, or complex network of nodes and links, and used eigenvector centrality (EC) to characterize brain network properties. The EC mapping of fMRI data in healthy humans under propofol mild sedation demonstrated a decrease of centrality of the thalamus versus an increase of centrality within the pons of the brainstem, highlighting the important role of these two structures in regulating consciousness. Specifically, the decrease of thalamus centrality results from its disconnection from a widespread set of cortical and subcortical regions, while the increase of brainstem centrality may be a consequence of its increased influence, in the mildly sedated state, over a few highly central cortical regions key to the default mode network such as the posterior and anterior cingulate cortices. © 2013 the authors.","Gili, Tommaso;Saxena, Neeraj;Diukova, Ana;Murphy, Kevin;Hall, Judith E.;Wise, Richard G.",13310221100;36459102300;36466398000;57203737996;20433306100;35394428700
10.1152/jn.00416.2011,16,"A consistent and prominent feature of brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is the presence of low-frequency (<0.1 Hz) fluctuations of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal that are thought to reflect spontaneous neuronal activity. In this report we provide modeling evidence that cyclic physiological activation of astroglial cells produces similar BOLD oscillations through a mechanism mediated by intracellular Ca2 + signaling. Specifically, neurotransmission induces pulses of Ca2 + concentration in astrocytes, resulting in increased cerebral perfusion and neuroactive transmitter release by these cells (i.e., gliotransmission), which in turn stimulates neuronal activity. Noticeably, the level of neuron-astrocyte cross talk regulates the periodic behavior of the Ca2 + wave-induced BOLD fluctuations. Our results suggest that the spontaneous ongoing activity of neuroglial networks is a potential source of the observed slow fMRI signal oscillations. © 2011 the American Physiological Society.","di Nuzzo, Mauro;Gili, Tommaso;Maraviglia, Bruno;Giove, Federico",35109148000;13310221100;7005434101;6603200123
10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.08.069,64,"Previous studies suggest that the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are not only associated with regional gray matter damage but also with abnormal functional integration of different brain regions by disconnection mechanisms. A measure of anatomical connectivity (anatomical connectivity mapping or ACM) can be obtained by initiating diffusion tractography streamlines from all parenchymal voxels and then counting the number of streamlines passing through each voxel of the brain. In order to assess the potential of this parameter for the study of disconnection in AD, we computed it in a group of patients with AD (N= 9), in 16 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI, which is considered the prodromal stage of AD) and in 12 healthy volunteers. All subjects had an MRI scan at 3. T, and diffusion MRI data were analyzed to obtain fractional anisotropy (FA) and ACM. Two types of ACM maps, absolute count (ac-ACM) and normalized by brain size count (nc-ACM), were obtained. No between group differences in FA surviving correction for multiple comparison were found, while areas of both decreased (in the supramarginal gyrus) and increased (in the putamen) ACM were found in patients with AD. Similar results were obtained with ac-ACM and nc-ACM. ACM of the supramarginal gyrus was strongly associated with measures of short-term memory in healthy subjects. This study shows that ACM provides information that is complementary to that offered by FA and appears to be more sensitive than FA to brain changes in patients with AD. The increased ACM in the putamen was unexpected. Given the nature of ACM, an increase of this parameter may reflect a change in any of the areas connected to it. One intriguing possibility is that this increase of ACM in AD patients might reflect processes of brain plasticity driven by cholinesterase inhibitors. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Bozzali, Marco;Parker, Geoffrey J.M.;Serra, Laura;Embleton, Karl;Gili, Tommaso;Perri, Roberta;Caltagirone, Carlo;Cercignani, Mara",6701548417;24766914700;8266381200;15060926500;13310221100;7003629644;35228717800;6603813790

Methods: Ten patients with amnesic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI), 11 patients with probable AD and 10 healthy controls were recruited. T1 volumes were obtained from each subject and postprocessed according to an optimised voxel based morphometry protocol. Resting state functional MRI data were also collected from the same individuals and analysed to produce connectivity maps after identification of the default mode network (DMN) by independent component analysis. Results: Compared with healthy controls, both AD and a- MCI patients showed a similar regional pattern of brain disconnection between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the medial prefrontal cortex and the rest of the brain. Conversely, the distribution of GM atrophy was significantly more restricted in a-MCI than in AD patients. Interestingly, the PCC showed reduced connectivity in a- MCI patients in the absence of GM atrophy, which was, in contrast, detectable at the stage of fully developed AD. Conclusions: This study indicates that disconnection precedes GM atrophy in the PCC, which is a critical area of the DMN, and supports the hypothesis that GM atrophy in specific regions of AD brains likely reflects a long term effect of brain disconnection. In this context, our study indicates that GM atrophy in PCC accompanies the conversion from MCI to AD.","Gili, T.;Cercignani, M.;Serra, L.;Perri, R.;Giove, F.;Maraviglia, B.;Caltagirone, C.;Bozzali, M.",13310221100;6603813790;8266381200;7003629644;6603200123;7005434101;35228717800;6701548417

These parameters can be easily measured by means of a radiowave dielectric spectroscopy technique, analyzing the dependence of the electrical impedance of an erythrocyte suspension on the frequency of the applied electric field.

The scaling approach to the transport properties of polyelectrolyte solutions allows us to separate contributions due to polymer conformation from those due to the ionic character of the chain, and offers the possibility to extend the validity of the Manning conductivity model to the dilute and semidilute regimes. Moreover, the quality of the solvent, influencing the polyion-counterion interactions, can be properly taken into account. The electrical conductivity predicted by this scaling approach compares reasonably well with the observed values for a model polyelectrolyte (polyacrylate sodium salt in aqueous solutions, good solvent condition) over an extended concentration range from the dilute to the semidilute regime. © 2002 The American Physical Society.","Bordi, F.;Cametti, C.;Gili, T.",7007171362;56247959600;13310221100
10.1021/la020175h,15,"The radiowave dielectric behavior of sodium polyacrylate (NaPAA) aqueous solutions, in an extended concentration range and at various degrees of polymerization, was analyzed in the light of the scaling approach for polyelectrolyte solutions recently proposed by Dobrynin et al. [Macromolecules 1995, 28, 1859]. In the frequency range from 1 MHz to 1 GHz, the observed dielectric relaxation is attributed to the fluctuation of loosely bound counterions over a characteristic correlation length which depends on the polymer concentration. Assuming that free counterions fluctuate on a length scale that is proportional to the correlation length ξ0 of the semidilute solution, we derived power laws for the dielectric strength Δε and the relaxation frequency ν0. In agreement with our recently published data on conductivity, the dielectric data indicate that the effective charge on the NaPAA chains increases as concentration is raised, until the correlation length reaches the size of the electrostatic blob. By comparing the dielectric behavior of a series of polymers exhibiting different affinities for water as a solvent, we showed that the scaling behavior furnishes a very good description of the observed concentration dependence of the dielectric parameters. These findings suggest a method for evaluating, from simple dielectric measurements, the solvent quality parameter τ for the uncharged polyelectrolyte chain, a parameter which up to now eluded a precise determination by means of other experimental techniques. Finally, a correlation between the fraction f of free counterions and the solvent quality parameter τ, in poor solvent conditions, was evidenced. This gives further support to the hypothesis that the effective polyelectrolyte-solvent entropic interaction is primarily dictated by the effective charge on the chain.","Bordi, F.;Cametti, C.;Gili, T.;Colby, R.

10.1021/jp020262i,86,"The d.c. electrical conductivity of polyacrylate sodium salt and poly(acrylic acid) aqueous solutions of different molecular weights from 2 to 200 kD has been investigated in a wide range of polymer concentration, covering both the semidilute (unentangled and entangled) and concentrated regimes. The data have been analyzed on the basis of a modified version of the Manning theory of counterion condensation, to cover the semidilute regime, taking into account scaling arguments recently proposed by Dobrynin et al. (Macromolecules 1995, 28, 1859). This analysis, on the basis of the conductivity model we have adopted, provides evidence for a fraction of free counterions that increases with the polymer concentration until the semidilute-concentrated crossover concentration is reached, suggesting that, in the concentration range investigated, the effective charge on the polyion is dependent on the polymer concentration. Moreover, at the higher concentrations investigated, our data suggest that a regime is attained where electrostatic blobs overlap, strongly affecting the electrical transport properties of the solution and causing a progressive reduction of the free counterion concentration.","Bordi, F.;Colby, R.

The passive electrical properties of the cell membrane (the membrane permittivity ε′ and the membrane conductivity σ) have been evaluated on the basis of the Maxwell-Wagner-Hanai and Looyenga mixture equations and the results have been compared in order to discuss the validity of the two models employed. Based on a simultaneous fit of the permittivity ε′ and the electrical conductivity σ, the Looyenga equation furnishes a better description of the dielectric behavior of an erythrocyte cell suspension over an extended frequency range, in comparison to the Maxwell-Wagner-Hanai equation. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

10.1002/jbm.1221,7,"The exposure of a biomaterial to blood gives rise to complex reactions playing an important role in many biological phenomena, such as the problem of biocompatibility and the mechanism of cardiovascular and thromboembolic diseases. In the present work, we use a frequency-domain dielectric spectroscopy approach to evaluate possible changes in the passive electrical parameters of the erythrocyte membrane, i.e., the membrane conductivity σ s and the membrane permittivity ε s, after the insertion of a prosthesis (mean implantation time 8 days) in the circulatory system of patients treated for aortic aneurysm and the consequent interactions of erythrocyte cells with the biomaterial surface. We observe an increase of both the membrane conductivity and membrane permittivity, indicating changes at molecular level in the structural organization of the membrane. These membrane alterations can be viewed as precursory events for the initiation of the complex sequence of enzymatic reactions that take place on the material surface. Our results, although preliminary imply that a direct interaction between erythrocyte cell membrane and vascular prostheses may occur, causing a marked alteration in the electrical properties of the cell membrane. These findings might have relevant clinical implications and might offer possibilities to predict biocompatibility of biomaterials and give some further suggestions to resolve the problem of biomaterial-associated thrombogenicity. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Basoli, A.;Bordi, F.;Cametti, C.;Gili, T.",7003982049;7007171362;56247959600;13310221100
10.1016/S1567-5394(01)00110-4,131,"Electrode polarization effects in dielectric spectra of highly conductive biological cell suspensions cause a severe difficulty in the estimation of dielectric parameters of cells under physiological conditions. This problem becomes particularly serious with the increase of the electrical conductivity of the sample, preventing the use of low frequencies in the characterization of biological systems, especially aqueous biological systems. Although a variety of methods to correct the electrode polarization have been proposed in the past, no simple technique for its correction has been available so far. Since the magnitude of the polarization effect can be time-dependent owing to changes in the conductance of the suspending medium or to possible alteration in the electrode surface structure, it is clear that correction procedure should be based on a kind of ""self-correction"" method, avoiding the so-called ""comparison methods"" which, on the contrary, require time-independent effects. This note is aimed to address this problem considering an electrode polarization modelled by a constant phase angle (CPA) element in series with the sample admittance. A scaling-law frequency dependence has found to describe the a.c. response of the interface between the electrode and the bulk electrolyte solution. Although this approach has been extensively proposed in the past in the analysis of dielectric spectra of biological suspensions, we have somewhat modified the way it has been previously applied and have re-examined in detail its effectiveness in typical systems of biological interest. The results give support to the proposed analysis, allowing the complete low-frequency dielectric spectra characterization at frequencies of the order of 1 kHz for samples with a bulk ionic conductivity as large as that of the order of 1 mho/m. Typical examples with different dielectric behaviours are extensively discussed in order to show the applicability of the proposed method to biological samples. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

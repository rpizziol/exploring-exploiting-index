10.4324/9781003309895-22,0,"This chapter analyzes a crucial passage of the Long Commentary on the De anima by Averroes (Ibn Rushd, d. 1198 CE), one of his most informative criticisms of Avicenna (Ibn Sīnā, d. 1037 CE), and compares it with similar passages in other Aristotelian commentaries and other works by Averroes. This passage is a precious testimonium of the ways in which Avicenna’s philosophy was transmitted in Andalusia, since here and in other passages, Averroes’ knowledge of Avicenna’s thought is probably based on a particular summa by Avicenna, the Kitāb al-Shifāʾ (Book of the Cure, or of the Healing), which he apparently knew firsthand. The hypothesis is advanced that in these comments on Avicenna, Averroes may depend on the Introduction to the Kitāb al-Shifāʾ, authored by Avicenna’s biographer and secretary al-Jūzjānī (fifth century AH/eleventh century CE).","Bertolacci, Amos",26034043200

10.1484/J.QUAESTIO.5.133406,0,"The article has three interrelated aims. First, to document that the title “Book of Letters”, despite its fame, was far from being ‘traditional’ in Arabic philosophy, as it is often presented, but it rather served as a temporary designation of the Metaphysics in Arabic. Apart from later derivatives, this title is attested only four times, in different forms, in writings of the IV/X century, with no trace beforehand and a life-span of a few decades, from the time of the translation activity of Abū Bišr Mattā (d. 328H/940) until the compo-sition of an ethical work by Miskawayh (written between 358H/968 and 360H/970) and of the Fihrist (377H/987-8). This title soon disappeared from the philosophical scenario in the course of the V/XI century, when it apparently lost currency in philosophical contexts. The second aim is to shed some light on the origin of this expression. “Book of Letters” as a title of the Metaphysics comes, in fact, from a cultural environment different from the Ar-abic-Islamic one, namely from the Syriac tradition of Greek philosophy, or from its Pahlavi offshoots. The Syriac provenience is indicated by the first known user of this expression, Paul the Persian (VI c. CE). It is corroborated by the Syriac background of some parts of Alexander of Aphrodisias’ commentary on the Metaphysics preserved in Arabic, in which all the treatises of the Metaphysics are systematically designated through letters. The third aim is to explain the waning of the title under discussion with reference to Avicenna (Ibn Sīnā, d. 428H/1037) and his renewal of philosophical nomenclature in the V/XI century. The author of the Book of the Cure/Healing (Kitāb al-Šif āʾ) not only neglected the title at stake, as already others had done before him: in his masterpiece on metaphysics, he also proposed a new and alternative denomination of Aristotle’s eponymous work (“First Teaching”, al-ta ʿlīm al-awwal), which condemned to irrelevance the textual content of the Metaphysics and a fortiori its material arrangement in distinct treatise designated by means of letters.","Bertolacci, Amos",26034043200
10.46586/er.13.2022.9638,1,"The paper aims at providing a comprehensive description of the manuscript Rampur, Rampur Raza Library 3476 (hikma 112), which contains three of the four main parts of Avicenna's philosophical magnum opus, the Kitāb al-Šifā (the Book of the Cure or: of the Healing). This manuscript documents important developments in the history of Arabic-Islamic philosophy. First, it attests a precise intellectual genealogy within the influential Daštakī family from Shiraz, several exponents of which can be identified as successive owners of this manuscript at the turn of the ninth/fifteenth and tenth/sixteenth centuries, among whom one should mention Sadr al-Dīn Mohammad Daštakī Šīrāzī (d. 903/1498), the founder of the so-called “Šīrāzī school” of philosophy; Ġeyās̱ al-Dīn Mansūr Daštakī Šīrāzī (d. 948/1542), son of the preceding and author of the first extant commentary on the Ilāhiyyāt (Science of Divine Things, or Metaphysics) of the Šifā in Arabic presently known; and Fathollāh Šīrāzī (d. 997/1589), a student and possibly also a relative of Ġeyās̱ al-Dīn Mansūr Daštakī Šīrāzī, one of the main advocates and promoters of rationalism in India. Second, copied in 718/1318, the manuscript at hand highlights a crucial phase of the transmission of Avicenna's Šifā, at the pivotal juncture between the most ancient phase of dissemination of the work (fifth to seventh/eleventh to thirteenth centuries) and the later period of its manuscript production (ninth to fourteenth/fifteenth to twentieth centuries). Third, it offers a concrete and insightful specimen of the intellectual exchanges between the Safavid (1502-1736) and the Mughal (1530-1707) empires in the seminal and formative phase of cultural life in Iran and India in the tenth/sixteenth century, in an itinerary that from Shiraz, the place of origin of the Daštakī family, goes eastward in the direction of the Mughal court of Akbar I (r. 963-1014/1556-1605) until it reaches the Raza Library of Rampur at some point.","Bertolacci, Amos;Dadkhah, Gholamreza",26034043200;57224946973

,0,"Building on previous scholarship, the present article pursues three interrelated aims. First, the various typologies of statements that J. A. Weisheipl and subsequent scholarship record cumulatively under the general rubric of ‘disclaimers’ in Albert’s commentaries on Aristotle are distinguished, with the intent of assessing the various conceptual layers that reside within these contentions, and of narrowing this label, stricto sensu, only to some of them. Second, the evidential basis of the dossier on this topic is enlarged, by means of textual evidence merely mentioned, scarcely considered, or even completely overlooked before, in the footsteps of the most recent critical editions of Albert’s paraphrases and of the indexes and the lexica complementing the critical texts. Third, the possible origin of this motif of Albert’s Aristotelian commentaries is explained, in a double direction: on the one hand, the first emergence of this topic is precisely located within Albert’s production, pointing at the subsequent evolution of Albert’s stance on this issue; on the other hand, the historical ancestry of the disclaimers is retrieved within the Aristotelian and Peripatetic tradition, in such a way that this aspect of Albert’s exegesis of Aristotle reinforces, rather than diminishing or jeopardising, the author’s advocacy of the Peripatetism that he is expounding in the commentaries.","Bertolacci, Amos",26034043200
10.1163/18778372-04701600,1,"The present article brings to the scholarly attention the Avicennian manuscript San Lorenzo de El Escorial (Madrid), Real Biblioteca del Monasterio de San Lorenzo de El Escorial, 621, by conveying a basic description of its codicological features and by locating it in the wider context of the connection metaphysics-medicine that the transmission of Avicenna's magnum opus Kitāb al-Šifā (Book of the Cure/Healing) displays. The manuscript at stake is the only extant, though incomplete, codex of the Ilāhiyyāt (Science of Divine Things) of Avicenna's Šifā presently known in the Iberian peninsula (Spain and Portugal), and one of the few codices of the Šifā housed there. In its present state, it cumulates metaphysics and medicine, since it joins some excerpts of the Ilāhiyyāt with fragments of the commentaries on Avicenna's Al-Qānūn fī l-ibb (Canon of Medicine) by Ibn al-Nafīs al-Qurašī (d. 687H/1288) and by Qub al-Dīn al-Šīrāzī (634-719H/1236-1311). The part of the commentary on Avicenna's Canon by Ibn al-Nafīs al-Qurašī preserved in this manuscript contains a revealing critical quotation of a medical tenet which Avicenna discusses in the Šifā; this criticism very likely represents an instance of the 'rectification' of Avicenna's philosophical encyclopedia of which Ibn al-Nafīs is credited in historical sources. The example of the revision of Avicenna's philosophy by Ibn al-Nafīs analyzed on the basis of this manuscript makes clear that physicians in the XIII century did not limit their familiarity with Avicenna's works to the Canon of Medicine and the other medical works of Avicenna, but adopted some kind of all-encompassing approach to Avicenna's oeuvre, which did not eschewed tackling critically also the Šifā on the basis of a profound and extensive knowledge of the Šay al-raīs's philosophical masterpiece.","Bertolacci, Amos",26034043200

,2,"The present article analyzes the evidence available in Arabic sources (preliminary lists of contents in manuscripts; texts of manuscripts; later quotations) that supports the hypothesis according to which the medieval Latin translation of the metaphysics of Avicenna’s Kitāb al-Šifā' is rooted in its Arabic background when it conveys an account of treatise V of the work (called ‘Versio Latina’) alternative to the one that can be found in the majority of codices and in current printings (‘Versio Vulgata’). It is argued (i) that the Versio Latina is probably more original than the Versio Vulgata, for doctrinal and philological reasons; (ii) that the Versio Vulgata might respond to a deliberate intention to make the content of treatise V more compliant with the account of universals provided by Avicenna himself in the logic of the Šifā' and, in general, with the traditional pre-Avicennian ways of expounding the doctrine of universals; (iii) and that the Versio Vulgata was likely the product of Avicenna’s school, rather than of Avicenna himself, as the result of shared concerns and theoretical debates that prompted the decision of modifying Avicenna’s original text through the intervention, in all likelihood, of al-Ğūzğānī. Two further issues are conclusively discussed: (iv) how precisely the Latin translation relates to the Arabic background of the Versio Latina, (v) and whether the Versio Latina can be taken as the outlook of treatise V intended and licensed by Avicenna, or it also conveys elements of later, non authorial modifications.","Bertolacci, Amos",26034043200

10.1007/978-94-007-5240-5_2,10,"The first criticism of Avicenna in Averroes’s Long Commentary on Metaphysica (II, 993a30-995a20) regards Avicenna’s doctrine of the asexual (so-called ‘spontaneous’) generation of human beings. This criticism is interesting in two main regards. When considered in the general historical context of the confrontation between advocates and opponents of spontaneous generation, the specific debate between Averroes and Avicenna on this issue can be said to have had a long-lasting impact on Latin philosophy up until the Renaissance. Doctrinally, the criticism in question can be taken as a paradigm of Averroes’s more general anti-Avicennian polemic and of the ideological reasons of his dissent towards his illustrious predecessor. In fact, the criticism in questions displays three leitmotivs of Averroes’s dissent towards Avicenna: the harsh tone and the ad personam character of the attack, stressing an error unworthy of Avicenna’s alleged fame in philosophy; the insistence on Avicenna’s agreement and consonance with contemporary thinkers, a fact that in Averroes’s eyes evidences the profound gap separating Avicenna from the ancient masters, depositaries of authentic philosophy; the reproach addressed to Avicenna of being too conversant with, and receptive of, Islamic theology, thus disregarding the requirements of true philosophy. The article shows that in each of these three respects Averroes in fact presents Avicenna’s position in a biased way: indeed Avicenna does not uphold the specific version of human spontaneous generation that Averroes ascribes to him; his doctrine of human spontaneous generation is deeply rooted in ancient philosophy; and his account of this doctrine evidences clear non-religious (and therefore non-theological) traits.","Bertolacci, Amos",26034043200
10.1163/9789004235083_015,7,"A critical edition of the masterpiece of Avicenna's metaphysics-the Science of Divine Things (Ilāhiyyāt) of the Book of the Cure (Kitāb al-Šifā')-is much needed in order to assess the metaphysical thought of its author and the extent of his debt to Aristotle and the Peripatetic tradition. The example discussed in the present contribution regards the title of the very first chapter of the work, in which the term anniyya (""existence""), common to the current printed versions of the Illāhiyyāt, should arguably be corrected into ayyiyya (""essential quality""). The proposed correction is corroborated by the apparent use of the latter term (equally misreported as anniyya in available editions) in other parts of the Šifā', with particular regard to the reworking of Porphyry's Isagoge (Madhal), and sheds light on Avicenna's preservation of an instance of Kindian terminology also in a work strongly dependent on Farabian patterns like the Illāhiyyāt.","Bertolacci, Amos",26034043200

10.1163/18778372-00402005,3,"The article discusses the possibility that Avicenna's magnum opus in philosophy might have had multiple recensions, either by the author himself, or in a very early phase of its manuscript transmission, possibly as a result of scholarly discussions within Avicenna's school. As test case, the fifh treatise of the metaphysical section (Ila¯hiyya¯t) of the Kita¯b al-Šifa¯'is chosen: in some very ancient testimonia, this treatise presents an arrangement of chapters that is coherent and straightforward, but sensibly different-both in the number and the disposition of chapters-from the mainstream version transmitted by the current printed editions of the work. Some hypotheses on the origin of these variations-which cannot be classified as simple accidents of transmission, on account of their rational and macroscopic character-are finally advanced. Appendix B fixes to six the number of codices employed in the standard edition of the Ila¯hiyya¯t published in Cairo in 1960.","Bertolacci, Amos",26034043200

10.1017/CBO9781139047890.013,5,"Avicenna is famous for the enormous impact of his philosophical and medical works on subsequent thinkers belonging to the three monotheistic religions (Islam, Christianity, Judaism) and on the three cultures embracing the Mediterranean Sea (Arabic, Latin, Hebrew) during the Middle Ages. Outside the boundaries of the Arab-Islamic world, beginning with the last decades of the twelfth century, the two main branches of Avicenna's thought (philosophy and medicine) deeply influenced a great variety of Christian thinkers who used Latin as the language of communication, arousing among them a wide array of different reactions and attitudes. Borrowing the scheme coined by Dimitri Gutas for the reception of Avicenna in Arabic, we can envisage also the Latin fortuna of the shaykh ra?is according to a three-fold division, given by (more or less) faithful followers of the master, independent thinkers capable of revising some crucial tenets of his teaching, and outspoken critics who were not only polemical, but also indebted towards him. Avicenna's writings entered the official curricula of medieval universities, and were copied and commented upon, although less intensively than Aristotle's; as a consequence, they were mentioned frequently by philosophers, theologians, and physicians. But the scope of Avicenna's authority overcame the boundaries of the disciplines taught in universities, and the borders of academic faculties: his thought also entered other fields of Latin culture, like literature (as in the case of Dante Alighieri, among others), and society in general (as its traces in ecclesiastic documents witness). Given this massive impact throughout the medieval period, it is not surprising that the Western reception of Avicenna's philosophy did not end with the Middle Ages: thanks to the edition of the Latin translation of the main parts of Avicenna's Book of the Cure (Kitab al-Shifa?), accomplished by the Augustinian friars of San Giovanni in Verdara in Padua and printed by Ottaviano Scoto in Venice in 1508, it reached modern authors such as Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz.","Bertolacci, Amos",26034043200

Relying on the texts made available by Bouyges and the impressive amount of philological information conveyed in his edition, subsequent scholars have been able to select and focus on more specific topics, providing, for example, a closer inspection of the Arabic translations of the single books of the Metaphysics (books A, α, and Λ in particular), or a detailed comparison of some of these translations with the original text of the Metaphysics. A new trend of research in recent times has been the study of these versions as part of the wider context of the Graeco-Arabic translation movement.","Bertolacci, Amos",26034043200

,0,"IEEE 802.16 is a standard for Broadband Wireless Access networks, where a number of Subscriber Stations (SSs) are centrally controlled by a Base Station (BS). The Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol is connection-oriented and time is divided into frames of fixed duration. Moreover, MAC signaling is in-band, i.e. any frame carries both data and control messages. Therefore, the capacity available for data transmission is affected by the overhead due to control messages whose size, in turn, depends on several factors including the number of SSs that are scheduled in a frame. In this paper, we derive a set of formulae to compute the maximum throughput of best effort traffic in an IEEE 802.16 network. To this end, we only assume that the BS fairly shares the available resources among the connections. We validate our formulae through simulation, and, finally, we exploit the proposed formulae to investigate the throughput performance of IEEE 802.16 in a set of relevant scenarios.","Bacioccola, Andrea;Cicconetti, Claudio;Erta, Alessandro;Mingozzi, Enzo",22940439400;22033885800;24070321600;6602669130
10.1016/j.adhoc.2011.03.006,6,"The performance of a wireless mesh network (WMN) can be significantly affected by node failures and medium-term time-varying phenomena in the wireless channel, which may lead to significant interruptions in packet delivery service. Because of their nature, WMNs are often deployed with an inherent degree of redundancy. In principle, this flexibility might be exploited to cope with the link failure problem by temporarily re-routing ongoing traffic on alternate paths. However, the existing routing protocols cannot be used for this purpose, since they either rely on link-state updates, which happen on a longer time scale than the phenomena under consideration, or the decisions are taken by the source node, which does not know the status on intermediate links. In this paper we present a Fast Re-Routing enabled architecture that is optimized for WMNs and allows nodes to react to local node or link failures by activating a pre-configured alternate path to reach a two-hop neighbor. The proposed scheme is enabled by label switching/stacking. Alternate paths are created automatically during the path setup phase via a lightweight protocol derived from LDP. The solution is proved to be effective through a testbed implementation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

10.4018/978-1-60566-262-6.ch007,0,"Traditional analog video surveillance systems technology has recently become inadequate to face the massive demand of security systems consisting of hundreds and sometimes thousands of cameras often deployed in hostile environments miles away from the control room. During the last few years, the rapid growth of the digital technology has produced sophisticated cameras which can directly record high-definition digital videos. The packetized video stream can be straightforwardly conveyed to the control room, relaying on common IP network infrastructures. This solution result is extremely flexible as the network infrastructure can be built over a wide variety of heterogeneous network technologies from the traditional Ethernet-based Local Area Networks (LANs) to the recently proposed Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs). However, the widespread adoption of IP-based solutions for video surveillance poses serious problems in terms of required bandwidth, processing power, network security, and system dependability. In this chapter, we first investigate the advantages of the IP-based video surveillance systems over the traditional analog ones. Then, we describe the technical challenges and the open research issues which still lack an ultimate solution which permits to completely abandon the traditional analog technology. Finally, we propose and verify, by means of a case study, a methodology to address the design of video surveillance systems in real deployment. © 2009, IGI Global.","Badia, L.;Erta, A.;Malesci, U.",7004191275;24070321600;14027368200
10.1007/978-1-4020-9300-5_3,0,"The IEEE 802.16e standard specifies a connection-oriented centralized Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol, based on Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), which adds mobility support defined by the IEEE 802.16 standard for fixed broadband wireless access. To this end, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) is specified as the air interface. In OFDMA, the MAC frame extends over two dimensions: time, in units of OFDMA symbols, and frequency, in units of logical sub-channels. The Base Station (BS) is responsible for allocating data into the frames so as to meet the Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees of the Mobile Stations' (MSs) admitted connections. This is done on a frame-by-frame basis by defining the content of map messages, which advertise the position and shape of data regions reserved for transmission to/from MSs. We refer to the process of defining the content of map messages as frame allocation. Through a detailed analysis of the standard, we show that the latter is an overly complex task. We then propose a modular framework to solve the frame allocation problem, which decouples the constraints of data region allocation into the MAC frame, i.e. the definition of the position and shape of the data regions according to a set of scheduled grants, from the QoS requirements of connections. Allocation is carried out by means of the Sample Data Region Allocation algorithm (SDRA), which also supports Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (H-ARQ), an optional feature of IEEE 802.16e. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of SDRA by means of Monte Carlo analysis in several scenarios, involving mixed Voice over IP (VoIP) and Best Effort (BE) MSs with varied modulations, with different sub-carrier permutations and frequency re-use plans. © 2009 Springer Netherlands.","Bacioccola, Andrea;Cicconetti, Claudio;Erta, Alessandro;Lenzini, Luciano;Mingozzi, Enzo;Moilanen, Jani",22940439400;22033885800;24070321600;7005880990;6602669130;57215470008
10.1109/MAHSS.2008.4660056,6,"There is wide consensus that properly taking into account wireless interference is necessary to design high performance link scheduling algorithms for multi-hop networks. However, most approaches in the literature use simplified models, which significantly abstract from the physical behavior of wireless links. Indeed, the main problem in representing the wireless propagation conditions with a proper level of detail is the very large amount of information needed, that includes the wireless link gains between all node pairs. In this paper, we propose a greedy, centralized scheduler which is based on the physical interference model but aims at exploiting local information available at each node, in order to reduce global information exchange and therefore the overhead as well as the computational complexity of the algorithm. We prove the effectiveness of our approach by extensive simulation results.

Although technically challenging, cross-layering is, in fact, expected to bring significant benefits from the network resource exploitation standpoint to achieve high system utilization.

To this end, we introduce a taxonomy of wireless interference models to harmonize existing approaches presented in the literature.

10.1007/978-0-387-68839-8_8,3,"In aWireless Mesh Network (WMN) [1] end users are provided with wireless broadband connectivity by means of a pre-defined system hierarchy. To describe this organization, several notations can be used. In the following, we adopt the terminology of [2]. The end terminals, also referred to as Mesh Clients (MCs), are connected to special nodes, denoted as Mesh Routers (MRs). These nodes do not generate traffic, since they are simply meant to relay the packets of their MCs. Additionally, some MRs, called Mesh Access Points (MAPs), can be provided with a wired connection, and can therefore act as gateways toward the Internet. The MAPs are also wirelessly interconnected to all the other MRs in a multi-hop fashion, without necessarily following pre-defined paths. Instead, an MC can interact only with the MR it is connected to. MRs form what is usually named as the backbone of the WMN, which can physically cover a large region in a wireless manner. This structure offers a good cost/benefit balance, since it almost entirely avoids cable set up. For this reason, it is deemed to be applicable in rural areas, where the deployment of wireline networks may be too expensive. WMNs can also be envisaged for dense residential or business areas, and in general, anyplace where the installation of cables is difficult because of physical obstacles. There are several possibilities to specify the Medium Access Control (MAC) used by a WMN. These are often related to existing standards, especially IEEE 802.11 [3] and IEEE 802.16 [4], parts of which are dedicated toWMNs. Actually, the first hop from any MC to its related MR is often assumed to employ a radio access interface different from the one used in the backbone, and entirely orthogonal (i.e., perfectly non-interfering) to it, e.g., since it uses another frequency, and possibly another technology. Moreover, the first hop may adopt management strategies typical of cellular networks [5], and is therefore conceptually simpler. For this reason, we will not investigate this part of the WMN in greater detail. Conversely, realizing the interconnections among MRs poses many theoretical challenges, most of which are common to all kinds of multi-hop networks, such as ad hoc and sensor networks. However, when revising them for WMNs, some important properties come into play. Usually, MCs can be portable devices, whereas MRs and MAPs are not mobile. Therefore, the backbone management does not suffer from most mobility issues, neither at the transport layer (i.e., paths do not need to be updated), nor at the physical layer (channel variability is relatively moderate). Moreover, communications in a WMN are usually to or from the Internet, thus all routes have either the source or the destination in a MAP. Finally, as MRs can be easily placed near to a power outlet, energy saving is not an issue. These properties considerably distinguish the backbone of WMNs from an ad hoc network (for what concerns pre-defined hierarchy and absence of mobility) or a sensor network (lack of terminal battery limitations). The issues which arise in the backbone management relate to different layers of the protocol stack. On the one hand, the creation of low-interference and high-rate paths to the MAPs is key to achieve good rates at each MR. This may also involve the exploitation of multiple channels as, for example, MRs can own several Network Interface Cards (NICs), which can simultaneously operate on different frequencies. On the other hand, the link layer needs to schedule packets over multiple links in order to achieve good transmission parallelism and possibly forward more data towards the MAPs at the same time. The main problems which will be investigated by our analysis are: routing algorithms, i.e., network level procedures to discover efficient paths which connect the ordinary MRs (and therefore their MCs) to the MAPs. Note that routing strategies designed for ad hoc networks usually admit also peer-topeer communications, which are not common for WMNs. Moreover, the goal in WMNs is more often to obtain high system throughput rather than maximizing battery lifetime. link scheduling, which involves medium access level procedures to activate communication links. Its goal is to ensure network connectivity while at the same time satisfying physical constraints related to technology, interference and network management. cross-layer management, operating at an intermediate level with both network and link layer procedures, jointly addressing these problems. The aforementioned issues involve other related topics, which are also worth discussing. In certain cases very broad subjects are involved, which will be discussed here only for what concerns their impact on the definition of routing and scheduling strategies. There are also other aspects of these matters which fall out of the scope of the present article, and therefore, will not be discussed here in detail. However, the reader will be addressed to external references to find further material on them. Some of the related problems which will be framed into our analysis are: channel assignment and node placement: in our analysis, these are considered to be aspects of network deployment, which means they have already been per formed at the time routing or scheduling strategies are sought. However, it will be briefly outlined how it is possible to incorporate them into the same cross-layer framework used for routing and scheduling with a modular approach, thus with no need for significant modifications of the reasonings presented in the rest of the article. models of wireless interference: for this point, two important considerations must be made. First of all, we propose a detailed review and classification of the possible approaches to characterize interference. We try to resolve terminology ambiguity due to the use of different names for the same model or of the same name for distinct models in the literature. Moreover, we discuss the choice of the model itself, which is driven by two contrasting aspects. On the one hand, the interference model should be as accurate as possible. In this sense, the use of heavily simplified interference models may end up in poor algorithm performance when applied to realistic cases. On the other hand, a certain degree of approximation is unavoidable as related to the properties of the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol. In fact, in a layered network management, algorithms operating on top of the link layer necessarily abstract some aspects of the physical layer, such as interference. For these reasons, we will first concentrate our analysis on general results which hold true regardless of the interference model, such as theoretical performance bounds. Then, we will discuss how these findings translate to practical cases, at which point different interference models need to be taken into account. The rest of this chapter is organized as follows. In Section 8.2 we give a brief overview of the problem studied and we clarify terminology and notations employed in the rest of the chapter. In Section 8.3 we present a review of the works which discussed related topics in a way applicable to WMNs. In Section 8.4 we mathematically formalize the problem, in particular identifying the constraints determined by capabilities of the terminals and wireless interference. This latter aspect, in particular, is discussed in depth in Section 8.5, proposing a classification of interference models, and also touching MAC protocol issues. In Section 8.6 we give both theoretical and practical evaluations of the performance of WMNs. Even though the problem is NP-complete and exact approaches are hard, we present some original analytical results which determine both upper and lower performance bounds, and we give quantitative insights by applying them to sample WMN topologies. Finally, we present the conclusions. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. All rights reserved.","Badia, L.;Erta, A.;Lenzini, L.;Zorzi, M.",7004191275;24070321600;7005880990;7102431876

The distinctive feature of EBRP is that it is carried out at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer.

10.1109/TMC.2007.1064,16,"IEEE 802.16 is a recent IEEE standard for broadband wireless access networks. In IEEE 802.16 networks, the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol is centralized and explicitly supports quality of service (QoS). That is to say, access to the medium by a number of Subscriber Stations (SSs) is centrally controlled by one Base Station (BS), which is responsible for allocating bandwidth to several MAC connections in order to provide them with the negotiated QoS guarantees. However, although the network can be operated in Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) mode (that is, transmissions from the BS (downlink) and SSs (uplink) occur on separate frequency channels), the standard supports SSs with half-duplex capabilities. This means that they are equipped with a single radio transceiver which can be used either to transmit in the uplink direction or to receive in the downlink direction. This may severely hamper the capacity to support QoS. Therefore, in order to allocate bandwidth, an IEEE 802.16 BS has to solve two related issues: 1) how it can schedule bandwidth grants to SSs in order to meet the QoS requirements of their connections and 2) how it can coordinate the uplink and downlink scheduled grants so as to support half-duplex capabilities. In this paper, we derive sufficient conditions for a set of scheduled grants to be allocated so that the transmission of each half-duplex SS does not overlap with its reception. Based on this, we propose a grant allocation algorithm, namely, the Half-Duplex Allocation (HDA) algorithm, which always produces a feasible grant allocation provided that the sufficient conditions are met. HDA has a computation complexity of O(n), where n is the number of grants to be allocated. Finally, we show that the definition of HDA allows us to address the two issues mentioned above by following a pipeline approach. This is when scheduling and allocation are implemented by separate and independently running algorithms, which are just loosely coupled with each other. We show via extensive simulations that the performance of SSs with half-duplex capabilities, in terms of the delay of real-time and non-real-time interactive traffic, using HDA almost perfectly matches that of full-duplex SSs, whereas an alternative approach, based on the static partitioning of half-duplex SSs into separate groups, which are allocated alternately, is shown to degrade the performance. © 2007 IEEE.","Bacioccola, Andrea;Cicconetti, Claudio;Erta, Alessandro;Lenzini, Luciano;Mingozzi, Enzo",22940439400;22033885800;24070321600;7005880990;6602669130

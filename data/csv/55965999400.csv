We provide theoretical results, analytically proven, and we show how the proposed model fits the behaviors observed in some real data sets (from Reddit and Gutenberg). It is worth mentioning that the given applications are only examples of the potentialities of the proposed model and related results: due to its abstractness and generality, it can be applied to many interacting innovation processes.","Aletti, Giacomo;Crimaldi, Irene;Ghiglietti, Andrea",6603735678;55965999400;55782811300

It is a two-color urn model with multiple drawing and random (non-balanced) time-dependent reinforcement matrix. The number of sampled balls at each time-step is random. We identify the exact rates at which the number of balls of each color grows to +∞ and define two strongly consistent estimators for the limiting reinforcement averages. Then we prove a Central Limit Theorem, which allows to design a statistical test for such averages.","Crimaldi, Irene;Louis, Pierre Yves;Minelli, Ida G.",55965999400;8430222000;8971626600
10.1017/apr.2022.18,1,"The rich-get-richer rule reinforces actions that have been frequently chosen in the past. What happens to the evolution of individuals' inclinations to choose an action when agents interact? Interaction tends to homogenize, while each individual dynamics tends to reinforce its own position. Interacting stochastic systems of reinforced processes have recently been considered in many papers, in which the asymptotic behavior is proven to exhibit almost sure synchronization. In this paper we consider models where, even if interaction among agents is present, absence of synchronization may happen because of the choice of an individual nonlinear reinforcement. We show how these systems can naturally be considered as models for coordination games or technological or opinion dynamics.","Crimaldi, Irene;Louis, Pierre Yves;Minelli, Ida G.",55965999400;8430222000;8971626600
10.1177/00491241221147503,0,"Policy evaluation studies, which assess the effect of an intervention, face statistical challenges: in real-world settings treatments are not randomly assigned and the analysis might be complicated by the presence of interference among units. Researchers have started to develop methods that allow to manage spillovers in observational studies; recent works focus primarily on binary treatments. However, many studies deal with more complex interventions. For instance, in political science, evaluating the impact of policies implemented by administrative entities often implies a multi-valued approach, as a policy towards a specific issue operates at many levels and can be defined along multiple dimensions. In this work, we extend the statistical framework about causal inference under network interference in observational studies, allowing for a multi-valued individual treatment and an interference structure shaped by a weighted network. The estimation strategy relies on a joint multiple generalized propensity score and allows one to estimate direct effects, controlling for both individual and network covariates. We follow this methodology to analyze the impact of the national immigration policy on the crime rate, analyzing data of 22 OECD countries over a thirty-years time frame. We define a multi-valued characterization of political attitude towards migrants and we assume that the extent to which each country can be influenced by another country is modeled by an indicator, summarizing their cultural and geographical proximity. Results suggest that implementing a highly restrictive immigration policy leads to an increase of the crime rate and the estimated effect is larger if we account for interference.","Tortú, Costanza;Crimaldi, Irene;Mealli, Fabrizia;Forastiere, Laura",57219630528;55965999400;6602895492;57194521428
10.1017/apr.2021.56,3,"Motivated by recent studies of big samples, this work aims to construct a parametric model which is characterized by the following features: (i) a 'local' reinforcement, i.e. a reinforcement mechanism mainly based on the last observations, (ii) a random persistent fluctuation of the predictive mean, and (iii) a long-term almost sure convergence of the empirical mean to a deterministic limit, together with a chi-squared goodness-of-fit result for the limit probabilities. This triple purpose is achieved by the introduction of a new variant of the Eggenberger-Pólya urn, which we call the rescaled Pólya urn. We provide a complete asymptotic characterization of this model, pointing out that, for a certain choice of the parameters, it has properties different from the ones typically exhibited by the other urn models in the literature. Therefore, beyond the possible statistical application, this work could be interesting for those who are concerned with stochastic processes with reinforcement.","Aletti, Giacomo;Crimaldi, Irene",6603735678;55965999400

The model is very general with respect to previous literature: the number of sampled balls at each time-step is random, the addition matrix is not balanced and it has general random entries. For the proportion of balls of a given color, we prove almost sure convergence results. In particular, in the case of equal reinforcement averages, we prove fluctuation theorems (through CLTs in the sense of stable convergence and of almost sure conditional convergence, which are stronger than convergence in distribution) and we give asymptotic confidence intervals for the limit proportion, whose distribution is generally unknown.","Crimaldi, Irene;Louis, Pierre Yves;Minelli, Ida G.",55965999400;8430222000;8971626600
10.1214/22-EJS1993,1,"We introduce the Generalized Rescaled Pólya (GRP) urn, that provides a generative model for a chi-squared test of goodness of fit for the long-term probabilities of clustered data, with independence between clusters and correlation, due to a reinforcement mechanism, inside each cluster. We apply the proposed test to a data set of Twitter posts about COVID-19 pandemic: in a few words, for a classical chi-squared test the data result strongly significant for the rejection of the null hypothesis (the daily long-run sentiment rate remains constant), but, taking into account the correlation among data, the introduced test leads to a different conclusion. Beside the statistical application, we point out that the GRP urn is a simple variant of the standard Eggenberger-Pólya urn, that, with suitable choices of the parameters, shows “local” reinforcement, almost sure convergence of the empirical mean to a deterministic limit and different asymptotic behaviours of the predictive mean. Moreover, the study of this model provides the opportunity to analyze stochastic approximation dynamics, that are unusual in the related literature.","Aletti, Giacomo;Crimaldi, Irene",6603735678;55965999400
10.1038/s41598-021-00378-4,1,"In the existing literature about innovation processes, the proposed models often satisfy the Heaps’ law, regarding the rate at which novelties appear, and the Zipf’s law, that states a power law behavior for the frequency distribution of the elements. However, there are empirical cases far from showing a pure power law behavior and such a deviation is mostly present for elements with high frequencies. We explain this phenomenon by means of a suitable “damping” effect in the probability of a repetition of an old element. We introduce an extremely general model, whose key element is the update function, that can be suitably chosen in order to reproduce the behaviour exhibited by the empirical data. In particular, we explicit the update function for some Twitter data sets and show great performances with respect to Heaps’ law and, above all, with respect to the fitting of the frequency-rank plots for low and high frequencies. Moreover, we also give other examples of update functions, that are able to reproduce the behaviors empirically observed in other contexts.","Aletti, Giacomo;Crimaldi, Irene",6603735678;55965999400

10.1371/journal.pone.0249634,5,"Twitter is among the most used online platforms for the political communications, due to the concision of its messages (which is particularly suitable for political slogans) and the quick diffusion of messages. Especially when the argument stimulate the emotionality of users, the content on Twitter is shared with extreme speed and thus studying the tweet sentiment if of utmost importance to predict the evolution of the discussions and the register of the relative narratives. In this article, we present a model able to reproduce the dynamics of the sentiments of tweets related to specific topics and periods and to provide a prediction of the sentiment of the future posts based on the observed past. The model is a recent variant of the Pó lya urn, introduced and studied in Aletti and Crimaldi (2019, 2020), which is characterized by a ""local"" reinforcement, i.e. a reinforcement mechanism mainly based on the most recent observations, and by a random persistent fluctuation of the predictive mean. In particular, this latter feature is capable of capturing the trend fluctuations in the sentiment curve. While the proposed model is extremely general and may be also employed in other contexts, it has been tested on several Twitter data sets and demonstrated greater performances compared to the standard Pó lya urn model. Moreover, the different performances on different data sets highlight different emotional sensitivities respect to a public event.","Aletti, Giacomo;Crimaldi, Irene;Saracco, Fabio",6603735678;55965999400;36344077800

The post-global financial crisis (GFC), literature agrees on a reduced lending pace by financial institutions (FIs) as a result of stricter capital regulations. At the same time, an increasing volume of outstanding loans, directed even to advanced countries, characterize the balance sheet of several multilateral development banks (MDBs). Design/methodology/approach: This paper observes how a different degree of banking regulation might have shaped the economic response to the GFC by FIs and MDBs. Findings: The authors indicate that MDBs’ financing, with a coherent objective of countercyclical support to the economies hit by the GFC, seems to have filled a market gap caused by the FIs’ pro-cyclical lending reduction. Originality/value: While a controversial issue is whether Basel standards should be imposed on MDBs, a harmonization amongst MDBs of their transparency and reporting standards might be beneficial: some preliminary consideration has been portrayed.","Gianfagna, Laura;Crimaldi, Irene;Gallan, Davide",57193508867;55965999400;57225044892
10.3390/E22050573,3,"Taylor's law quantifies the scaling properties of the fluctuations of the number of innovations occurring in open systems. Urn-based modeling schemes have already proven to be effective in modeling this complex behaviour. Here, we present analytical estimations of Taylor's law exponents in such models, by leveraging on their representation in terms of triangular urn models. We also highlight the correspondence of these models with Poisson-Dirichlet processes and demonstrate how a non-trivial Taylor's law exponent is a kind of universal feature in systems related to human activities. We base this result on the analysis of four collections of data generated by human activity: (i) written language (from a Gutenberg corpus); (ii) an online music website (Last. fm); (iii) Twitter hashtags; (iv) an online collaborative tagging system (Del. icio. us). While Taylor's law observed in the last two datasets agrees with the plain model predictions, we need to introduce a generalization to fully characterize the behaviour of the first two datasets, where temporal correlations are possibly more relevant. We suggest that Taylor's law is a fundamental complement to Zipf's and Heaps' laws in unveiling the complex dynamical processes underlying the evolution of systems featuring innovation.","Tria, Francesca;Crimaldi, Irene;Aletti, Giacomo;Servedio, Vito D.P.",56006074300;55965999400;6603735678;6603522133
10.3150/19-BEJ1143,10,"This work deals with a system of interacting reinforced stochastic processes, where each process Xj = (Xn,j )n is located at a vertex j of a finite weighted directed graph, and it can be interpreted as the sequence of ""actions"" adopted by an agent j of the network. The interaction among the dynamics of these processes depends on the weighted adjacency matrix W associated to the underlying graph: Indeed, the probability that an agent j chooses a certain action depends on its personal ""inclination"" Zn,j and on the inclinations Zn,h, with h ≠= j , of the other agents according to the entries of W. The best known example of reinforced stochastic process is the Pólya urn. The present paper focuses on the weighted empirical means Nn,j =Σn k=1 qn,kXk,j , since, for example, the current experience is more important than the past one in reinforced learning. Their almost sure synchronization and some central limit theorems in the sense of stable convergence are proven. The new approach with weighted means highlights the key points in proving some recent results for the personal inclinations Zj = (Zn,j )n and for the empirical means X j = ( Σn k=1 Xk,j/n)n given in recent papers (e.g. Aletti, Crimaldi and Ghiglietti (2019), Ann. Appl. Probab. 27 (2017) 3787-3844, Crimaldi et al. Stochastic Process. Appl. 129 (2019) 70-101). In fact, with a more sophisticated decomposition of the considered processes, we can understand how the different convergence rates of the involved stochastic processes combine. From an application point of view, we provide confidence intervals for the common limit inclination of the agents and a test statistics to make inference on the matrix W, based on the weighted empirical means. In particular, we answer a research question posed in Aletti, Crimaldi and Ghiglietti (2019).","Aletti, Giacomo;Crimaldi, Irene;Ghiglietti, Andrea",6603735678;55965999400;55782811300
10.1371/journal.pone.0223768,1,"In this work we investigate how future actions are influenced by the previous ones, in the specific contexts of scientific collaborations and friendships on social networks. We describe the activity of the agents, providing a model for the formation of the bipartite network of actions and their features. Therefore we only require to know the chronological order in which the actions are performed, and not the order in which the agents are observed. Moreover, the total number of possible features is not specified a priori but is allowed to increase along time, and new actions can independently show some new-entry features or exhibit some of the old ones. The choice of the old features is driven by a degree-fitness method: indeed, the probability that a new action shows one of the old features does not solely depend on the popularity of that feature (i.e. the number of previous actions showing it), but it is also affected by some individual traits of the agents or the features themselves, synthesized in certain quantities, called fitnesses or weights, that can have different forms and different meaning according to the specific setting considered. We show some theoretical properties of the model and provide statistical tools for the parameters' estimation.

10.1214/17-AAP1296,13,"Randomly evolving systems composed by elements which interact among each other have always been of great interest in several scientific fields. This work deals with the synchronization phenomenon that could be roughly defined as the tendency of different components to adopt a common behavior. We continue the study of a model of interacting stochastic processes with reinforcement that recently has been introduced in [Crimaldi et al. (2016)]. Generally speaking, by reinforcement we mean any mechanism for which the probability that a given event occurs has an increasing dependence on the number of times that events of the same type occurred in the past. The particularity of systems of such interacting stochastic processes is that synchronization is induced along time by the reinforcement mechanism itself and does not require a large-scale limit. We focus on the relationship between the topology of the network of the interactions and the long-time synchronization phenomenon. After proving the almost sure synchronization, we provide some CLTs in the sense of stable convergence that establish the convergence rates and the asymptotic distributions for both convergence to the common limit and synchronization. The obtained results lead to the construction of asymptotic confidence intervals for the limit random variable and of statistical tests to make inference on the topology of the network.","Aletti, Giacomo;Crimaldi, Irene;Ghiglietti, Andrea",6603735678;55965999400;55782811300

We define an indicator that combines several distress drivers and observe that results on co-dependencies are similar to those that would be expected: similarities between financial and contractual terms seem to be responsible for stronger co-movements among sub-markets. However, high values for JPoD even in correspondence of quite dissimilar sub-markets suggest the presence of other drivers that should be investigated in future research.

10.1016/j.ins.2016.02.057,6,"The quest for a model that is able to explain, describe, analyze and simulate real-world complex networks is of uttermost practical, as well as theoretical, interest. In fact, networks can be a natural way to represent many phenomena; often, they arise from a complex interweaving of some features of the nodes. For example, in a co-authorship network, a link stems more easily between authors with similar interests; similarly, in a genetic regulatory network, links are affected by the different biological functions of the regulators. In this paper we introduce and study a novel network model that is based on a latent attribute structure: this model, inspired by a generalization of the Indian Buffet process, is simple and contains a small number of parameters, with a clear and intuitive role. Each node is characterized by a number of features and the probability of the existence of an edge between two nodes depends on the features they share; the number of possible features is not fixed a priori and can grow indefinitely. Moreover, a random fitness parameter is introduced for each node in order to determine its ability to transmit its own features to other nodes; this behavior is added on top of a process of Indian-Buffet type. Because of the fitness property, a node's connectivity does not depend on its age alone, so that also ""young but fit"" nodes are able to compete and succeed in propagating their features and acquiring links. We also show how, considering the resulting bipartite node-attribute network, it is possible to gain some insight about which nodes were originally the most ""fit"". Our model for this bipartite network depends on few parameters, that are characterized by their straightforward interpretation and by the availability of proper estimators. Even if the parameters are easy to interpret and tune, the model is general enough to represent complex phenomena - e.g., homophily, heterophily, or any interplay between features. We provide some theoretical as well as experimental results regarding the power-law behavior of the model and the proposed tools for the estimation of the parameters. We also show, through a number of experiments, how the proposed model naturally captures most local and global properties (e.g., degree distributions, connectivity and distance distributions) real networks exhibit.","Boldi, Paolo;Crimaldi, Irene;Monti, Corrado",6701696387;55965999400;55969647800

Moreover, the proposed tool can be applied also to dense networks, which have received little attention by the network community so far, since they are often problematic. We apply our procedure in the context of the International Trade Network, determining a core of ""dominant edges."" © 2013 American Physical Society.","Caldarelli, Guido;Chessa, Alessandro;Crimaldi, Irene;Pammolli, Fabio",55139905100;6604050350;55965999400;6603423982
10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503362,2,"In order to estimate the Hurst parameter of Internet traffic data, it has been recently proposed a log-regression estimator based on the so-called modified Allan variance (MAVAR). Simulations have shown that this estimator achieves higher accuracy and better confidence when compared with an other method of common use based on wavelet analysis. Here we link it to the wavelets setting and stress why a different analysis for the two approaches is required. We then focus on the asymptotic analysis of the MAVAR log-regression estimator and provide new formulas for the related confidence intervals. By numerical evaluation, we analyze these formulas and make a comparison between three suitable choices on the regression weights, also optimizing over different choices on the data progression. © 2012 IEEE.","Bianchi, Alessandra;Bregni, Stefano;Crimaldi, Irene;Ferrari, Marco",25652765800;7003896139;55965999400;55734348663

10.1239/aap/1275055237,24,"In this paper the theory of species sampling sequences is linked to the theory of conditionally identically distributed sequences in order to enlarge the set of species sampling sequences which are mathematically tractable. The conditional identity in distribution (see Berti, Pratelli and Rigo (2004)) is a new type of dependence for random variables, which generalizes the well-known notion of exchangeability. In this paper a class of random sequences, called generalized species sampling sequences, is defined and a condition to have conditional identity in distribution is given. Moreover, two types of generalized species sampling sequence that are conditionally identically distributed are introduced and studied: the generalized Poisson-Dirichlet sequence and the generalized Ottawa sequence. Some examples are discussed. © Applied Probability Trust 2010.","Bassetti, Federico;Crimaldi, Irene;Leisen, Fabrizio",14318874700;55965999400;26028933900
10.1016/j.spa.2010.04.005,11,"An urn contains balls of d ≥ 2 colors. At each time n ≥ 1, a ball is drawn and then replaced together with a random number of balls of the same color. Let An = diag (An,1, . . . , An,d) be the n-th reinforce matrix. Assuming that E An,j = E An,1 for all n and j , a few central limit theorems (CLTs) are available for such urns. In real problems, however, it is more reasonable to assume that E A n,j = E An,1 whenever n ≥ 1 and 1 ≤ j ≤ d 0, limn inf E An,1 > limn sup E An,j whenever j > d0, for some integer 1 ≤ d 0 ≤ d. Under this condition, the usual weak limit theorems may fail, but it is still possible to prove the CLTs for some slightly different random quantities. These random quantities are obtained by neglecting dominated colors, i.e., colors from d0+1 to d, and they allow the same inference on the urn structure. The sequence (An: n ≥ 1) is independent but need not be identically distributed. Some statistical applications are given as well. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

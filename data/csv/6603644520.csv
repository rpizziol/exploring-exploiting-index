10.1016/j.apm.2023.06.001,0,"This work discusses the correct modeling of the fully nonlinear free surface boundary conditions to be prescribed in water waves flow simulations based on potential flow theory. The main goal of such a discussion is that of identifying a mathematical formulation and a numerical treatment that can be used both to carry out transient simulations, and to compute steady solutions — for any flow admitting them. In the literature on numerical towing tank in fact, steady and unsteady fully nonlinear potential flow solvers are characterized by different mathematical formulations. The kinematic and dynamic fully nonlinear free surface boundary conditions are discussed, and in particular it is proven that the kinematic free surface boundary condition, written in semi-Lagrangian form, can be manipulated to derive an alternative non penetration boundary condition by all means identical to the one used on the surface of floating bodies or on the basin bottom. The simplified mathematical problem obtained is discretized over space and time via Boundary Element Method (BEM) and Implicit Backward Difference Formula (BDF) scheme, respectively. The results confirm that the solver implemented is able to solve steady potential flow problems just by eliminating null time derivatives in the unsteady formulation. Numerical results obtained confirm that the solver implemented is able to accurately reproduce results of classical steady flow solvers available in the literature.","Mola, Andrea;Giuliani, Nicola;Crego, Óscar;Rozza, Gianluigi",6603644520;57197118605;57196087676;55882527500
10.1016/j.amc.2023.127920,2,"In this paper, we propose hybrid data-driven ROM closures for fluid flows. These new ROM closures combine two fundamentally different strategies: (i) purely data-driven ROM closures, both for the velocity and the pressure; and (ii) physically based, eddy viscosity data-driven closures, which model the energy transfer in the system. The first strategy consists in the addition of closure/correction terms to the governing equations, which are built from the available data. The second strategy includes turbulence modeling by adding eddy viscosity terms, which are determined by using machine learning techniques. The two strategies are combined for the first time in this paper to investigate a two-dimensional flow past a circular cylinder at Re=50,000. Our numerical results show that the hybrid data-driven ROM is more accurate than both the purely data-driven ROM and the eddy viscosity ROM.","Ivagnes, Anna;Stabile, Giovanni;Mola, Andrea;Iliescu, Traian;Rozza, Gianluigi",57748694200;55948136700;6603644520;35487620800;55882527500

Specifically, we propose the first pressure-based data-driven variational multiscale ROM, in which we use the available data to construct closure/correction terms for both the momentum equation and the continuity equation. Our numerical investigation of the two-dimensional flow past a circular cylinder at Re=50,000 in the marginally-resolved regime shows that the novel pressure data-driven variational multiscale ROM yields significantly more accurate velocity and pressure approximations than the standard ROM and, more importantly, than the original data-driven variational multiscale ROM (i.e., without pressure components). In particular, our numerical results show that adding the closure/correction term in the momentum equation significantly improves both the velocity and the pressure approximations, whereas adding the closure/correction term in the continuity equation improves only the pressure approximation.","Ivagnes, Anna;Stabile, Giovanni;Mola, Andrea;Iliescu, Traian;Rozza, Gianluigi",57748694200;55948136700;6603644520;35487620800;55882527500
10.1145/3468428,9,"The traditional workflow in continuum mechanics simulations is that a geometry description - for example obtained using Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) or Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools - forms the input for a mesh generator. The mesh is then used as the sole input for the finite element, finite volume, and finite difference solver, which at this point no longer has access to the original, ""underlying""geometry. However, many modern techniques - for example, adaptive mesh refinement and the use of higher order geometry approximation methods - really do need information about the underlying geometry to realize their full potential. We have undertaken an exhaustive study of where typical finite element codes use geometry information, with the goal of determining what information geometry tools would have to provide. Our study shows that nearly all geometry-related needs inside the simulators can be satisfied by just two ""primitives"": elementary queries posed by the simulation software to the geometry description. We then show that it is possible to provide these primitives in all of the frequently used ways in which geometries are described in common industrial workflows, and illustrate our solutions using a number of examples.","Heltai, Luca;Bangerth, Wolfgang;Kronbichler, Martin;Mola, Andrea",23974171800;6508189083;56998515600;6603644520

First, a low-dimensional description of the flow fields is presented with modal decomposition analysis. Sensitivity towards the DMD and POD bases truncation rank is discussed, and extensive dataset is provided to demonstrate the ability of both algorithms to reconstruct the flow fields with all the spatial and temporal frequencies necessary to support accurate noise evaluation. Results show that while DMD is capable to capture finer coherent structures in the wake region for the same amount of employed modes, reconstructed flow fields using POD exhibit smaller magnitudes of global spatiotemporal errors compared with DMD counterparts. Second, a separate set of DMD and POD modes generated using half the snapshots is employed into two data-driven reduced models respectively, based on DMD mid cast and POD with Interpolation (PODI). In that regard, results confirm that the predictive character of both reduced approaches on the flow fields is sufficiently accurate, with a relative superiority of PODI results over DMD ones. This infers that, discrepancies induced due to interpolation errors in PODI is relatively low compared with errors induced by integration and linear regression operations in DMD, for the present setup. Finally, a post processing analysis on the evaluation of FWH acoustic signals utilizing reduced fluid dynamic fields as input demonstrates that both DMD and PODI data-driven reduced models are efficient and sufficiently accurate in predicting acoustic noises.","Gadalla, Mahmoud;Cianferra, Marta;Tezzele, Marco;Stabile, Giovanni;Mola, Andrea;Rozza, Gianluigi",57220368865;57200030849;57191962888;55948136700;6603644520;55882527500

In this contribution, a data-driven framework involving multiple reduction techniques is proposed to reduce such computational burden. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and active subspace genetic algorithm (ASGA) are applied for a dimensional reduction of the original (high fidelity) model and for an efficient genetic optimization based on active subspace property. The parameterization of the shape is applied directly to the computational mesh, propagating the generic deformation map applied to the surface (of the object to optimize) to the mesh nodes using a radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Thus, topology and quality of the original mesh are preserved, enabling application of POD-based reduced order modeling techniques, and avoiding the necessity of additional meshing steps. Model order reduction is performed coupling POD and Gaussian process regression (GPR) in a data-driven fashion.

,6,"In this work, we present the results of a ship propeller design optimization campaign carried out in the framework of the research project PRELICA, funded by the Friuli Venezia Giulia regional government. The main idea of this work is to operate on a multidisciplinary level to identify propeller shapes that lead to reduced tip vortex-induced pressure and increased efficiency without altering the thrust. First, a specific tool for the bottom-up construction of parameterized propeller blade geometries has been developed. The algorithm proposed operates with a user defined number of arbitrary shaped or NACA airfoil sections, and employs arbitrary degree NURBS to represent the chord, pitch, skew and rake distribution as a function of the blade radial coordinate. The control points of such curves have been modified to generate, in a fully automated way, a family of blade geometries depending on as many as 20 shape parameters. Such geometries have then been used to carry out potential flow simulations with the Boundary Element Method based software PROCAL. Given the high number of parameters considered, such a preliminary stage allowed for a fast evaluation of the performance of several hundreds of shapes. In addition, the data obtained from the potential flow simulation allowed for the application of a parameter space reduction methodology based on active subspaces (AS) property, which suggested that the main propeller performance indices are, at a first but rather accurate approximation, only depending on a single parameter which is a linear combination of all the original geometric ones. AS analysis has also been used to carry out a constrained optimization exploiting response surface method in the reduced parameter space, and a sensitivity analysis based on such surrogate model. The few selected shapes were finally used to set up high fidelity RANS simulations and select an optimal shape.","Mola, Andrea;Tezzele, Marco;Gadalla, Mahmoud;Valdenazzi, Federica;Grassi, Davide;Padovan, Roberta;Rozza, Gianluigi",6603644520;57191962888;57220368865;55978581700;36630335500;55703776200;55882527500
,9,"In the reduced order modeling (ROM) framework, the solution of a parametric partial differential equation is approximated by combining the high-fidelity solutions of the problem at hand for several properly chosen configurations. Examples of the ROM application, in the naval field, can be found in [31, 24]. Mandatory ingredient for the ROM methods is the relation between the high-fidelity solutions and the parameters. Dealing with geometrical parameters, especially in the industrial context, this relation may be unknown and not trivial (simulations over hand morphed geometries) or very complex (high number of parameters or many nested morphing techniques). To overcome these scenarios, we propose in this contribution an efficient and complete data-driven framework involving ROM techniques for shape design and optimization, extending the pipeline presented in [7]. By applying the singular value decomposition (SVD) to the points coordinates defining the hull geometry — assuming the topology is inaltered by the deformation —, we are able to compute the optimal space which the deformed geometries belong to, hence using the modal coefficients as the new parameters we can reconstruct the parametric formulation of the domain. Finally the output of interest is approximated using the proper orthogonal decomposition with interpolation technique. To conclude, we apply this framework to a naval shape design problem where the bulbous bow is morphed to reduce the total resistance of the ship advancing in calm water.","Demo, Nicola;Tezzele, Marco;Mola, Andrea;Rozza, Gianluigi",57189296533;57191962888;6603644520;55882527500

In this work, we present a novel mesh generation strategy that can handle such “bad” input data and produces an anisotropic curvature-adapted surface mesh. There are two main ingredients to achieve this goal. First of all, we define a new and fast way to project point on an input model which overcomes the presence of non-connected patches.

Amplitudes, frequencies and phase lags of these harmonics are identified using a Parameter Identification (PI) procedure applied to time domain data of vortex induced forces, here obtained via CFD simulations. The proposed sharp identification via PI of the independent frequencies of the vortex shedding fluid force is the peculiarity of the proposed method.

In the framework of such typical naval architecture problem, several parametric deformations of an initial hull shape are considered to assess the influence of the shape parameters considered on the hull total drag. The hull resistance, which is the performance parameter associated with each parametric hull, is typically computed by means of numerical simulations of the hydrodynamic flow past the ship. Such problem is extremely relevant at the preliminary stages of the ship design, when several flow simulations are typically carried out by the engineers to establish a certain sensibility on the total drag dependence on the hull geometrical parameters considered and on other physical parameters. Given the high number of geometric and physical parameters involved which might result in a high number of time consuming hydrodynamic simulations assessing whether the parameters space can be reduced would lead to considerable computational cost reduction at the design stage.

To this end, a fully automated procedure has been implemented to produce several small shape perturbations of an original hull CAD geometry which are then used to carry out high-fidelity flow simulations in different cruise conditions and collect data for the active subspaces analysis.

The implementation is entirely based on open source libraries. The spatial discretization is solved using a streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin stabilization of an iso-parametric, collocation based, boundary element method, implemented using the open source library deal. II. The resulting nonlinear differential-algebraic system is integrated in time using implicit backward differentiation formulas, implemented in the open source library SUNDIALS. The Open CASCADE library is used to interface the model directly with computer-aided design data structures. The model accounts automatically for hulls with a transom stern, both in wet and dry regimes, by using a specific treatment of the free-surface nodes on the stern edge that automatically detects when the hull advances at low speeds. In this case, the transom stern is partially immersed, and a pressure patch is applied on the water surface detaching from the transom stern, to recover the gravity effect of the recirculating water on the underlying irrotational flow domain. The parameters of the model used to impose the pressure patch are approximated from experimental relations found in the literature. The test cases considered are those of the U.S. Navy Combatant DTMB-5415 and the National Physical Laboratory hull. Comparisons with experimental data on quasi-steady test cases for both water elevation and total hull drag are presented and discussed.

The govering Laplace equation is complemented by non penetration boundary conditions on the boat surface and by fully nonlinear kinematic and dynamic water free surface conditions, written in semi-Lagrangian form. The hull is represented as a three dimensional rigid body subjected to the action of gravity and hydrodynamic forces. The spatial discretization of the fluid dynamic problem is carried out by means of an iso-parametric collocation Boundary Element Method (BEM), which only requires the discretization of the domain boundary surfaces. In such framework, the markers at which the free surface kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions are collocated correspond to the nodes of the computational grid. The application of such spatial discretization results in a system of Differential Algebraic Equations (DAE), which is time-integrated by means of an implicit Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) scheme. As for the hull rigid body equations, they are added to the DAE system, so as to obtain a strong coupling between the fluid dynamic and structural solvers. Exploiting the simplicity of the surface grids required by BEM, the solver is fully integrated with CAD data structures. At the start of each simulation, the CAD file describing the hull is imported and used to automatically generate the computational grid. At each time step, the CAD surface is displaced in the current position, to obtain the proper horizontal positioning of the water nodes in contact with the hull. The model has been implemented in a stand alone C++ software (WaveBEM). The results of the simulations are compared with sinkage, trim experimental data available for the DTMB-5415 hull.","Mola, Andrea;Heltai, Luca;De Simone, Antonio",6603644520;23974171800;58267140200
10.1016/j.enganabound.2015.04.006,11,"In finite element formulations, transport dominated problems are often stabilised through the Streamline-Upwind-Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method. Its application is straightforward when the problem at hand is solved using Galerkin methods. Applications of boundary integral formulations often resort to collocation techniques which are computationally more tractable. In this framework, the Galerkin method and the stabilisation may still be used to successfully apply boundary conditions and resolve instabilities that are frequently observed in transport dominated problems. We apply this technique to an adaptive collocation boundary element method for the solution of stationary potential flows, where we solve a mixed Poisson problem in boundary integral form, with the addition of linearised free surface boundary conditions. We use a mixed boundary element formulation to allow for different finite dimensional spaces describing the flow potential and its normal derivative, and we validate our method simulating the flow around both a submerged body and a surface piercing body. The coupling of mixed surface finite elements and strongly consistent stabilisation techniques with boundary elements opens up the possibility to use non conformal unstructured grids with local refinement, without introducing the inconsistencies of other stabilisation techniques based on up-winding and finite difference schemes.","Giuliani, Nicola;Mola, Andrea;Heltai, Luca;Formaggia, Luca",57197118605;6603644520;23974171800;6701460926
,1,"We present the results of a reduced model for the simulation of three dimensional unsteady nonlinear water waves. The model, designed to evaluate the wave drag of arbitrarily shaped ship hulls, is based on the potential flow theory. The governing Laplace equation is complemented by non penetration boundary conditions on the hull, and with fully nonlinear boundary conditions on the water free surface. The spatial discretization of the resulting time dependent boundary value problem is carried out by means of a collocated and iso-parametric Boundary Element Method (BEM) implemented making use of the open source library deal.II. The time integration of the nonlinear differential-algebraic system resulting from the spatial discretization is performed by means of an implicit Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) method implemented in the open source library. The classes of the OpenCASCADE library have been used to interface the model with CAD data structures. The model also accounts for hulls with a transom stern. In such case, a specific treatment of the free surface nodes on the stern edge has been implemented. At low speeds, when the transom stern is partially immersed, a pressure patch is applied on the water surface detaching from the transom stern, to recover the gravity effect of the recirculating water on the underlying irrotational flow domain. The pressure patch is computed making use of experimental correlations obtained by Doctors et al. The test cases considered are that of the the US Navy Combatant DTMB-5415 and the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) hull. Numerical results are compared with experimental data.","Mola, Andrea;Heltai, Luca;De Simone, Antonio",6603644520;23974171800;58267140200
10.1016/j.proeng.2014.10.388,22,"A common representation of surfaces with complicated topology and geometry is through composite parametric surfaces as is the case for most CAD modelers. A challenging problem is how to generate a mesh of such a surface that well approximates the geometry of the surface, preserves its topology and important geometric features, and contains nicely shaped elements. In this work, we present an optimization-based surface remeshing method that is able to satisfy many of these requirements simultaneously. This method is inspired by the recent work of Levy and Bonneel (Proc. 21th International Meshing Roundtable, October 2012), which embeds a smooth surface into a high-dimensional space and remesh it uniformly in that embedding space. Our method works directly in the 3d spaces and uses an embedding space in R6 to evaluate mesh size and mesh quality. It generates a curvatureadapted anisotropic surface mesh that well represents the geometry of the surface with a low number of elements. We illustrate our approach through various examples.","Dassi, Franco;Mola, Andrea;Si, Hang",56045611100;6603644520;24734115200

10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0000034,5,"Square lighting poles with sharp or round corners have been observed to exhibit large amplitude oscillations with a frequency that is near that of their first mode. This frequency is one order of magnitude lower than that of the vortex shedding frequency for the observed wind speeds. As such, lock-in resonance between the vortex shedding and the poles motions has been ruled out as the cause of these oscillations. In this work, numerical simulations of flows over square cylinders with different aspect ratios and cross-sectional shapes have been carried out to explore and quantify low-frequency variations of the aerodynamic forces and their sources. The results show that low-frequency components are a basic aspect of the flow over finite length cylinders and are associated with the three-dimensional flow characteristics near the free end of the cylinder. This aspect is related to the loss of synchronization of the vortex shedding which, in turn, results in variations of the mean drag coefficient along the cylinder. This ability to numerically simulate the flow over a lighting pole and detailed results, as presented here, could be used to overcome wind tunnel test limitations imposed by the size of the test section and blockage ratio, and of meeting geometric similarity requirements for high aspect ratio configurations. Consequently, results from such simulations could play an important role in improving code specifications which, to date, have been based on wind tunnel simulations. © 2009 ASCE.","Mola, Andrea;Bordonaro, Giancarlo;Hajj, Muhammad R.",6603644520;24330546900;7003767315

The first one is a hollow circular cylinder of unlimited length, subjected to internal and external uniform pressure. The second one is a hollow or solid circular cylinder of finite length, subjected to twisting moments acting on its bases. In both cases, one of the axes of elastic symmetry is parallel to the cylinder axis; the other two are arbitrarily oriented in the plane of any cross-section of the solid. The elastic properties are invariant along the cylinder axis. The two problems are governed by formally similar sets of ordinary differential equations in the kinematic fields (in-plane displacements and microrotations).

10.1002/fld.743,2,"The paper's focus is the calculation of unsteady incompressible 2D flows past airfoils. In the framework of the primitive variable Navier-Stokes equations, the initial and boundary conditions must be assigned so as to be compatible, to assure the correct prediction of the flow evolution. This requirement, typical of all incompressible flows, viscous or inviscid, is often violated when modelling the flow past immersed bodies impulsively started from rest. Its fulfillment can however be restored by means of a procedure enforcing compatibility, consisting in a pre-processing of the initial velocity field, here described in detail. Numerical solutions for an impulsively started multiple airfoil have been obtained using a finite element incremental projection method. The spatial discretization chosen for the velocity and pressure are of different order to satisfy the inf-sup condition and obtain a smooth pressure field. Results are provided to illustrate the effect of employing or not the compatibility procedure, and are found in good agreement with those obtained with a non-primitive variable solver. In addition, we introduce a post-processing procedure to evaluate an alternative pressure field which is found to be more accurate than the one resulting from the projection method. This is achieved by considering an appropriate 'unsplit' version of the momentum equation, where the velocity solution of the projection method is substituted. © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Marra, A.;Mola, A.;Quartapelle, L.;Riviello, L.",7006030440;6603644520;7004038899;8543564800

10.1007/s10009-023-00731-0,2,"This paper advocates the use of compositional specifications based on formal languages as a means of modelling and analysing sophisticated collective behaviour in natural systems. With the use of appropriate linguistic constructs, models can be developed that are both compact and intuitive, and can be easily refined and extended in small steps. Automated workflows can be implemented on top of this methodology to provide quick feedback, enabling rapid design iterations. To support our argument, we present three examples from the natural world, focusing on flocks of birds and colonies of ants, which feature well-known examples of emergent behaviour in collective adaptive systems. We use an agent-based language to develop simple models that aim at capturing these collective phenomena, and discuss the specific language constructs that we use in the process. Then, we adapt an existing verification tool for the language to simulate our models, and show that our simulations do display emergent behaviour.","De Nicola, Rocco;Di Stefano, Luca;Inverso, Omar;Valiani, Serenella",7004298169;57205057932;55608826400;57893691300
10.1002/cpe.6749,4,"We analyze the protocol of the bitcoin blockchain by using the PRISM probabilistic model checker. In particular, we (i) extend PRISM with the ledger data type, (ii) model the behavior of the key participants in the protocol—the miners—and (iii) describe the whole protocol as a parallel composition of processes. The probabilistic analysis of the model highlights how forks happen and how they depend on specific parameters of the protocol, such as the difficulty of the cryptopuzzle and the network communication delays. Our results confirm that considering transactions in blocks at depth larger than 5 as confirmed is reasonable because the majority of miners have consistent blockchains up-to that depth with probability of almost 1. We also study the behavior of networks with churn miners, which may leave the network and rejoin afterwards, and with different topologies.","Bistarelli, Stefano;De Nicola, Rocco;Galletta, Letterio;Laneve, Cosimo;Mercanti, Ivan;Veschetti, Adele",7004079468;7004298169;55260418300;57204667252;57205026850;57211373939
10.1145/3543873.3587638,0,"For more than a decade scholars have been investigating the disinformation flow on social media contextually to societal events, like, e.g., elections. In this paper, we analyze the Twitter traffic related to the US 2020 pre-election debate and ask whether it mirrors the electoral system. The U.S. electoral system provides that, regardless of the actual vote gap, the premier candidate who received more votes in one state 'takes' that state. Criticisms of this system have pointed out that election campaigns can be more intense in particular key states to achieve victory, so-called swing states. Our intuition is that election debate may cause more traffic on Twitter-and probably be more plagued by misinformation-when associated with swing states. The results mostly confirm the intuition. About 88% of the entire traffic can be associated with swing states, and links to non-trustworthy news are shared far more in swing-related traffic than the same type of news in safe-related traffic. Considering traffic origin instead, non-trustworthy tweets generated by automated accounts, so-called social bots, are mostly associated with swing states. Our work sheds light on the role an electoral system plays in the evolution of online debates, with, in the spotlight, disinformation and social bots.","Pratelli, Manuel;Petrocchi, Marinella;Saracco, Fabio;De Nicola, Rocco",57218164872;9433836000;36344077800;7004298169
10.1007/978-3-031-47359-3_22,0,"Internet of Everything (IoE) is a newly emerging trend, especially in homes. Marketing forces toward smart homes are also accelerating the spread of IoE devices in households. An obvious risk of the rapid adoption of these smart devices is that many lack controls for protecting the privacy and security of end users from attacks designed to disrupt lives and incur financial losses. Today the smart home is a system for managing the basic life support processes of both small systems, e.g., commercial, office premises, apartments, cottages, and largely automated complexes, e.g., commercial and industrial complexes. One of the critical tasks to be solved by the concept of a modern smart home is the problem of preventing the usage of IoE resources. Recently, there has been a rapid increase in attacks on consumer IoE devices. Memory corruption vulnerabilities constitute a significant class of vulnerabilities in software security through which attackers can gain control of an entire system. Numerous memory corruption vulnerabilities have been found in IoE firmware already deployed in the consumer market. This paper aims to analyze and explain the resource usage attack and create a low-cost simulation environment to aid in the dynamic analysis of the attack. Further, we perform controlled resource usage attacks while measuring resource consumption on resource-constrained victims’ IoE devices, such as CPU and memory utilization. We also build a lightweight algorithm to detect memory usage attacks in the IoE environment. The result shows high efficiency in detecting and mitigating memory usage attacks by detecting when the intruder starts and stops the attack.","Alwaisi, Zainab;Soderi, Simone;De Nicola, Rocco",58656247000;56027760800;7004298169

To that end, we consider the case of a colony of foraging ants, where, for the combined effect of known biological mechanisms such as stigmergic interaction, pheromone release, and path integration, the ants will progressively work out the shortest path to move back and forth between their nest and a hypothetical food repository. Starting from an informal description in natural language, we show how to devise intuitive specifications for such scenario in a formal language. We then make use of a prototype software tool to formally assess whether such specifications would indeed replicate the expected collective behaviour of the colony as a whole.","De Nicola, Rocco;Di Stefano, Luca;Inverso, Omar;Valiani, Serenella",7004298169;57205057932;55608826400;57893691300
10.46298/lmcs-19(1:1)2023,0,"Variants of the must testing approach have been successfully applied in service oriented computing for analysing the compliance between (contracts exposed by) clients and servers or, more generally, between two peers. It has however been argued that multiparty scenarios call for more permissive notions of compliance because partners usually do not have full coordination capabilities. We propose two new testing preorders, which are obtained by restricting the set of potential observers. For the first preorder, called uncoordinated, we allow only sets of parallel observers that use different parts of the interface of a given service and have no possibility of intercommunication. For the second preorder, that we call individualistic, we instead rely on parallel observers that perceive as silent all the actions that are not in the interface of interest. We have that the uncoordinated preorder is coarser than the classical must testing preorder and finer than the individualistic one. We also provide a characterisation in terms of decorated traces for both preorders: the uncoordinated preorder is defined in terms of must-sets and Mazurkiewicz traces while the individualistic one is described in terms of classes of filtered traces that only contain designated visible actions and must-sets.","DE NICOLA, Rocco;Melgratti, Hernán",7004298169;10042207200
10.1016/j.scico.2022.102863,1,"Coordination languages for tuple spaces can offer significant advantages in the specification and implementation of distributed systems, but often do require manual programming effort to ensure consistency. We propose an experimental technique for automated replication of tuple spaces in distributed systems. The system of interest is modelled as a concurrent Go program where different threads represent the behaviour of the separate components, each owning its own local tuple repository. We automatically transform the initial program by combining program transformation and static analysis, so that tuples are replicated depending on the components' read-write access patterns. In this way, we turn the initial system into a replicated one where the replication of tuples is automatically achieved, while avoiding unnecessary replication overhead. Custom static analyses may be plugged in easily in our prototype implementation. We see this as a first step towards developing a fully-fledged framework to support designers to quickly evaluate many classes of replication-based systems under different consistency levels.","De Nicola, Rocco;Di Stefano, Luca;Inverso, Omar;Uwimbabazi, Aline",7004298169;57205057932;55608826400;57314875800
10.1145/3490387,5,"Sequential emulation is a semantics-based technique to automatically reduce property checking of distributed systems to the analysis of sequential programs. An automated procedure takes as input a formal specification of a distributed system, a property of interest, and the structural operational semantics of the specification language and generates a sequential program whose execution traces emulate the possible evolutions of the considered system. The problem as to whether the property of interest holds for the system can then be expressed either as a reachability or as a termination query on the program. This allows to immediately adapt mature verification techniques developed for general-purpose languages to domain-specific languages, and to effortlessly integrate new techniques as soon as they become available. We test our approach on a selection of concurrent systems originated from different contexts from population protocols to models of flocking behaviour. By combining a comprehensive range of program verification techniques, from traditional symbolic execution to modern inductive-based methods such as property-directed reachability, we are able to draw consistent and correct verification verdicts for the considered systems.","Di Stefano, Luca;De Nicola, Rocco;Inverso, Omar",57205057932;7004298169;55608826400
10.1007/978-3-031-19759-8_6,4,"We argue that compositional specification based on formal languages can facilitate the modelling of, and reasoning about, sophisticated collective behaviour in many natural systems. One defines a system in terms of individual components and local rules, so that collective behaviours emerge naturally from the combined effect of the different actions of the individual components. With appropriate linguistic constructs, this can yield compact and intuitive models that are easy to refine and extend in small incremental steps. In addition, automated workflows implemented on top of this methodology can provide quick feedback, thereby allowing rapid design iterations. To support our argument, we consider flocking, a well-known example of emergent behaviour in collective adaptive systems. We build a minimalistic bottom-up model of a flock of birds incrementally, discussing specific language constructs as we go along. We then describe a prototype simulator, and use it to validate our model in a controlled experiment, where a flock is attacked by a bird of prey. The flock effectively reacts to the attack by splitting into smaller groups and regathering once the threat subsides, consistently with both natural observations and previous models from the literature.","De Nicola, Rocco;Di Stefano, Luca;Inverso, Omar;Valiani, Serenella",7004298169;57205057932;55608826400;57893691300

10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3139456,15,"Visible Light Communication (VLC) is a key technology for the sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication thanks to the possibility of using artificial environmental lights as a data transfer channel. Although VLC systems are more resistant against interference and less susceptible to security vulnerabilities like most wireless networks, VLC is even inherently susceptible to eavesdropping attacks. Moreover, since VLC is considered an enabling technology for 6G, specific mechanisms are needed to enforce data security. This paper considers improving the security of the next generation of wireless communications by using the Watermark Blind Physical Layer Security (WBPLSec) in VLCs. The main intuition is that RGB LEDs offer the possibility for Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) as a useful support for the Spread-Spectrum (SS) watermarking. In this paper, we propose an approach that aims at obtaining VLC Physical Layer Security (PLS) by combining watermarking with an RGB LED jamming. We provide a performance analysis of the proposed security architecture based on the secrecy capacity in terms of its existence and outage probability. We prove that WBPLSec can be used to significantly improve confidentiality in the next generation of wireless communications. The results offer the possibility of creating a secure region around the legitimate receiver by leveraging the jamming optical power.","Soderi, S.;De Nicola, R.",56027760800;7004298169

10.1140/epjds/s13688-021-00289-4,35,"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on every human activity and, because of the urgency of finding the proper responses to such an unprecedented emergency, it generated a diffused societal debate. The online version of this discussion was not exempted by the presence of misinformation campaigns, but, differently from what already witnessed in other debates, the COVID-19 -intentional or not- flow of false information put at severe risk the public health, possibly reducing the efficacy of government countermeasures. In this manuscript, we study the effective impact of misinformation in the Italian societal debate on Twitter during the pandemic, focusing on the various discursive communities. In order to extract such communities, we start by focusing on verified users, i.e., accounts whose identity is officially certified by Twitter. We start by considering each couple of verified users and count how many unverified ones interacted with both of them via tweets or retweets: if this number is statically significant, i.e. so great that it cannot be explained only by their activity on the online social network, we can consider the two verified accounts as similar and put a link connecting them in a monopartite network of verified users. The discursive communities can then be found by running a community detection algorithm on this network. We observe that, despite being a mostly scientific subject, the COVID-19 discussion shows a clear division in what results to be different political groups. We filter the network of retweets from random noise and check the presence of messages displaying URLs. By using the well known browser extension NewsGuard, we assess the trustworthiness of the most recurrent news sites, among those tweeted by the political groups. The impact of low reputable posts reaches the 22.1% in the right and center-right wing community and its contribution is even stronger in absolute numbers, due to the activity of this group: 96% of all non reputable URLs shared by political groups come from this community.","Caldarelli, Guido;De Nicola, Rocco;Petrocchi, Marinella;Pratelli, Manuel;Saracco, Fabio",55139905100;7004298169;9433836000;57218164872;36344077800

Bots are computer algorithms whose use is far from being benign: malicious bots are purposely created to distribute spam, sponsor public characters and, ultimately, induce a bias within the public opinion. To fight the bot invasion on our online ecosystem, several approaches have been implemented, mostly based on (supervised and unsupervised) classifiers, which adopt the most varied account features, from the simplest to the most expensive ones to be extracted from the raw data obtainable through the Twitter public APIs. In this exploratory study, using Twitter as a benchmark, we compare the performances of four state-of-art feature sets in detecting novel bots: one of the output scores of the popular bot detector Botometer, which considers more than 1,000 features of an account to take a decision; two feature sets based on the account profile and timeline; and the information about the Twitter client from which the user tweets.

10.1002/cpe.5800,34,"The current cloud market is dominated by a few providers, which offer cloud services in a take-it-or-leave-it manner. However, the dynamism and uncertainty of cloud environments may require the change over time of both application requirements and service capabilities. The current service-level agreement (SLA) management solutions cannot easily guarantee a trustworthy, distributed SLA adaptation due to the centralized authority of the cloud provider who could also misbehave to pursue individual goals. To address the above issues, we propose a novel SLA management framework, which facilitates the specification and enforcement of dynamic SLAs that enable one to describe how, and under which conditions, the offered service level can change over time. The proposed framework relies on a two-level blockchain architecture. At the first level, the smart SLA is transformed into a smart contract that dynamically guides service provisioning. At the second level, a permissioned blockchain is built through a federation of monitoring entities to generate objective measurements for the smart SLA/contract assessment. The scalability of this permissioned blockchain is also thoroughly evaluated. The proposed framework enables creating open distributed clouds, which offer manageable and dynamic services, and facilitates cost reduction for cloud consumers, while it increases flexibility in resource management and trust in the offered cloud services.","Uriarte, Rafael Brundo;Zhou, Huan;Kritikos, Kyriakos;Shi, Zeshun;Zhao, Zhiming;De Nicola, Rocco",54586128100;57190840986;23094135300;57210789876;55726169800;7004298169

,0,"Malware is a constant threat for the security of devices and users. Successful and automatic malware detection is a critical necessity [1]. Existing malware detection solutions cannot accurately characterize the behavior of a malware and, thereby, they rely on other indicators, e.g., digital signatures. Nevertheless, behavior-based detection is an active field of research since it can deal with zero-day malware. Although many proposals leveraging machine learning (ML) classifiers have been put forward, finding proper behavioral features is still an open problem. Existing solutions typically consider either static or dynamic software features. Static refers to the program syntax while dynamic refers to features observed at runtime. However, both of them suffer from limitations which impact on the effectiveness of the ML classification. Here we follow a different approach. We used symbolic execution to model features that denote the malware behavior in a more precise way. To this aim, we introduce a novel feature specification language called Symbolic Feature Specification Language (SFSL). Each rule precisely models a specific malicious behavior that has been documented in past malware samples. Then, we apply local, bounded symbolic exploration to establish whether a binary under analysis matches the defined rules. Eventually, the result of the rule matching process is used to generate vectors of features for a ML classifier. Our current experiments with different ML classifiers show that this technique can lead to actual improvements of the classification accuracy. Moreover, since behavioral features do not depend on the program syntax, our methodology can even detect threats in new malware samples.","Siwach, Chinmay;Costa, Gabriele;de Nicola, Rocco",57258768000;32067717500;7004298169

This paper introduces the special section on “Rigorous Engineering of Collective Adaptive Systems.” It presents the seven contributions of the section and gives a short overview of the field of rigorously engineering collective adaptive systems by structuring it according to three topics: systematic development, methods and theories for modelling and analysis, and techniques for programming and operating collective adaptive systems.","De Nicola, Rocco;Jähnichen, Stefan;Wirsing, Martin",7004298169;6603142903;7003572775

These systems are usually distributed, heterogeneous, decentralised and interdependent, and are operating in dynamic and possibly unpredictable environments. Finding ways to understand and design these systems and, most of all, to model the interactions of their components, is a difficult but important endeavour. In this article we propose a language-based approach for programming the interactions of collective-adaptive systems by relying on attribute-based communication; a paradigm that permits a group of partners to communicate by considering their run-time properties and capabilities. We introduce AbC, a foundational calculus for attribute-based communication and show how its linguistic primitives can be used to program a sophisticated variant of the well-known problem of Stable Allocation in Content Delivery Networks. In our variant, content providers are assigned to clients based on collaboration and by taking into account the preferences of both parties in a fully anonymous and distributed settings. We also illustrate the expressive power of attribute-based communication by showing the natural encoding of group-based, publish/subscribe-based and channel-based communication paradigms into AbC.","Abd Alrahman, Yehia;De Nicola, Rocco;Loreti, Michele",57215204711;7004298169;56274825200

Indeed, they can easily reach a wide audience at a high speed; but exactly because of this they are the preferred medium for influencing public opinion via so-called fake news. Moreover, there is a general agreement that the main vehicle of fakes news are malicious software robots (bots) that automatically interact with human users.In previous work we have considered the problem of tagging human users in Online Social Networks as credulous users. Specifically, we have considered credulous those users with relatively high number of bot friends when compared to total number of their social friends. We consider this group of users worth of attention because they might have a higher exposure to malicious activities and they may contribute to the spreading of fake information by sharing dubious content.In this work, starting from a dataset of fake news, we investigate the behaviour and the degree of involvement of credulous users in fake news diffusion. The study aims to: (i) fight fake news by considering the content diffused by credulous users; (ii) highlight the relationship between credulous users and fake news spreading; (iii) target fake news detection by focusing on the analysis of specific accounts more exposed to malicious activities of bots. Our first results demonstrate a strong involvement of credulous users in fake news diffusion.

This brings significant benefits in terms of lower latency and higher bandwidth. However, by definition, edge computing has limited resources with respect to cloud counterparts; thus, there exists a trade-off between proximity to users and resource utilization. Moreover, service availability is a significant concern at the edge of the network, where extensive support systems as in cloud data centers are not usually present. To overcome these limitations, we propose a score-based edge service scheduling algorithm that evaluates network, compute, and reliability capabilities of edge nodes. The algorithm outputs the maximum scoring mapping between resources and services with regard to four critical aspects of service quality. Our simulation-based experiments on live video streaming services demonstrate significant improvements in both network delay and service time. Moreover, we compare edge computing with cloud computing and content delivery networks within the context of latency-sensitive and data-intensive applications. The results suggest that our edge-based scheduling algorithm is a viable solution for high service quality and responsiveness in deploying such applications.","Aral, Atakan;Brandic, Ivona;Uriarte, Rafael Brundo;De Nicola, Rocco;Scoca, Vincenzo",35298684700;8927203000;54586128100;7004298169;57191273902

Close proximity to producers and consumers of data brings significant benefits in latency and bandwidth. However, edge resources are, by definition, limited in comparison to cloud counterparts, thus, a trade-off exists between deploying a service closest to its users and avoiding resource overload. We propose a score-based edge service scheduling algorithm that evaluates both network and computational capabilities of edge nodes and outputs the maximum scoring mapping between services and resources. Our extensive simulation based on a live video streaming service, demonstrates significant improvements in both network delay and service time. Additionally, we compare edge computing technology with the state-of-the-art cloud computing and content delivery network solutions within the context of latency-sensitive and data-intensive applications. Our results show that edge computing enhanced with suggested scheduling algorithm is a viable solution for achieving high quality of service and responsivity in deploying such applications.","Scoca, Vincenzo;Aral, Atakan;Brandic, Ivona;De Nicola, Rocco;Uriarte, Rafael Brundo",57191273902;35298684700;8927203000;7004298169;54586128100

Probabilistic testing equivalence, which relies only on extremal success probabilities, is backward compatible with testing equivalences for re- stricted classes of processes, such as fully nondeterministic processes or generative/reactive probabilistic processes, only if specific sets of tests are admitted. In this paper, new versions of probabilistic trace and testing equivalences are presented for the general class of nondeterministic and probabilistic processes. The new trace equivalence is coarser because it compares execution probabilities of single traces instead of entire trace distributions, and turns out to be compositional. The new testing equivalence requires matching all resolu- tions of nondeterminism on the basis of their success probabilities, rather than comparing only extremal success probabilities, and considers success probabilities in a trace-by-trace fashion, rather than cumulatively on entire resolutions. It is fully backward compatible with testing equivalences for restricted classes of processes; as a consequence, the trace-by-trace approach uniformly captures the standard probabilistic testing equivalences for generative and reactive probabilistic processes. The paper discusses in full details the new equivalences and provides a simple spectrum that relates them with existing ones in the setting of nondeterministic and probabilistic processes. © M.

This regulation needs to be defined through a contract, the so-called Service Level Agreement (SLA). We argue that the current solutions for SLA specification cannot cope with the distinctive characteristics of clouds. Therefore, in this paper we define a language, named SLAC, devised for specifying SLA for the cloud computing domain. The main differences with respect to the existing specification languages are: SLAC is domain specific, its semantics are formally defined in order to avoid ambiguity, it supports the main cloud deployment models, and it enables the specification of multi-party agreements. Moreover, SLAC supports the business aspects of the domain, such as pricing schemes, business actions and metrics. Furthermore, SLAC comes with an open-source software framework which enables the specification, evaluation and enforcement of SLAs for clouds. We illustrate potentialities and effectiveness of the SLAC language and its management framework by experimenting with an Open Nebula cloud system.","Uriarte, Rafael Brundo;Tiezzi, Francesco;De Nicola, Rocco",54586128100;23089657900;7004298169

The state reachability distribution is a function mapping each possible target state to a value that expresses the degree of one-step reachability of that state. Values are taken from a preordered set equipped with a minimum that denotes unreachability.

This last property corresponds to a Conduché property for enriched functors, and a very rigid formulation of it has been used by Lawvere to characterise the determinacy of physical systems. We also consider the setting where some labels are not visible, and provide characterisations for weak and branching bisimilarity. Both equivalences are still characterised in terms of enriched functors that reflect paths with their factorisations: for branching bisimilarity, the property is the same as the one used to characterise strong bisimilarity when all labels are visible; for weak bisimilarity, a weaker form of path factorisation lifting is needed. This fact can be seen as evidence that strong and branching bisimilarity are strictly related and that, unlike weak bisimilarity, they preserve process determinacy in the sense of Milner.

,0,"Klaim (a Kernel Language for Agents Interaction and Mobility) is an experimental programming language specifically designed for programming mobile agents that supports a programming paradigm where both processes and data can be moved across different computing environments. The language relies on the use of explicit localities, and on allocation environments that associate logical localities to physical sites. The language consists of core Linda with multiple located tuple spaces and of a set of process operators, borrowed from Milner's CCS. Klaim tuple spaces and processes are distributed over different localities, which are considered as rst-class data. Linda operations are indexed with the locations of the tuple space they operate on. This allows programmers to distribute/retrieve data and processes over/from different nodes directly. Programmers share their control with what we call the net coordinators. Net coordinators describe the distributed infrastructure necessary for managing physical distribution of processes, allocation policies, and agents mobility. Klaim provides direct support for expressing and enforcing security policies that control access to resources and data. In particular, Klaim uses types to protect resources and data and to establish policies for access control. The type system guarantees that the operations that processes intend to perform at various network sites comply with the processes' access rights. Types are used to describe the intentions (read, write, execute,…) of processes relative to the different localities that they are willing to interact with, or that they want to migrate to. Type checking then determines whether processes comply with the declared intentions, and whether they have been assigned the necessary rights to perform the intended operations at the speci ed localities. The Klaim type system encompasses both subtyping and recursively defined types. The former occurs naturally when considering hierarchies of access rights, while the latters are needed to model migration of recursive processes. We are actually working on extending both the language and the type system for introducing types for tuples (record types), notions of multi{level security (by structuring localities into levels of security) and public or shared keys to model dynamic transmission of access rights. Other ongoing research is considering the extension of the language to deal with \open"" systems and with hierarchical nets. The interested reader is referred to for written material about our project, for related software (a Java implementation of the topic of Klaim is available), and for forthcoming additional written documentation.","Nicola, Rocco De",7004298169

10.1007/3-540-54430-5_77,0,Process algebras are generally recognized as a convenient tool for describing concurrent systems at different levels of abstraction. They rely on a small set of basic operators which correspond to primitive notions on concurrent systems and on one or more notions of behavioural equivalence or preorder. The operators are used to build complex systems from more elementary ones. The behavioural equivalences are used to study the relationships between different descriptions of the same system at different levels of abstractions and thus to perform part of the analysis.,"De Nicola, Rocco",7004298169
,53,"Three temporal logics are introduced which induce on labeled transition systems the same identifications as branching bisimulation. The first is an extension of Hennessy-Milner logic with a kind of unit operator. The second is another extension of Hennessy-Milner logic which exploits the power of backward modalities. The third is CTL* with the next-time operator interpreted over all paths, not just over maximal ones. A relevant side effect of the last characterization is that it sets a bridge between the state- and event-based approaches to the semantics of concurrent systems.","De Nicola, Rocco;Vaandrager, Frits",7004298169;6701396047
10.1016/0304-3975(90)90095-Y,46,"A new operational semantics for ""pure"" CCS is proposed that considers the parallel operator as a first class one, and permits a description of the calculus in terms of partial orderings. The new semantics (also for unguarded agents) is given in the SOS style via the partial ordering derivation relation. CCS agents are decomposed into sets of sequential subagents. The new derivations relate sets of subagents, and describe their actions and the casual dependencies among them. The computations obtained by composing partial ordering derivations are ""observed"" either as interleaving or partial orderings of events. Interleavings coincide with Milner's many step derivations, and ""linearizations"" of partial orderings are all and only interleavings. Abstract semantics are obtained by introducing two relations of observational equivalence and congruence that preserve concurrency. These relations are finer than Milner's in that they distinguish interleaving of sequential nondeterministic agents from their concurrent execution. © 1990.","Degano, P.;De Nicola, R.;Montanari, U.",7006345611;7004298169;7004968272

In particular, logical characterizations of observational (bisimulation) equivalences based on partial ordering observations are studied. To date, in contrast with the interleaving approach, such equivalences have been almost exclusively studied from the operational standpoint. We shall show that they can be defined in a logical setting and that standard modal and temporal techniques can also be applied to true concurrency models. As a result, the interleaving and the partial ordering views of concurrency are reconciled within a logical setting.","De Nicola, Rocco;Ferrari, Gian Luigi",7004298169;56221627000

It is proved that it has essentially the same power as CTL*, a temporal logic interpreted over Kripke structures. The relationship between the two logics is established by introducing two mappings from Kripke structures to labelled transition systems and viceversa and two transformation functions between the two logics which preserve truth. A branching time version of the action based logic is also introduced. This new logic for transition systems can play an important role as an intermediate between Hennessy-Milner Logic and the modal μ-calculus. It is sufficiently expressive to describe safety and liveness properties but permits model checking in linear time.","De Nicola, Rocco;Vaandrager, Frits",7004298169;6701396047

10.1007/BFb0039058,65,"This paper is concerned with bisimulation relations which do not only require related agents to simulate each others behavior in the direction of the arrows, but also to simulate each other when going back in history. First it is demonstrated that the back and forth variant of strong bisimulation leads to the same equivalence as the ordinary notion of strong bisimulation. Then it is shown that the back and forth variant of Milner's observation equivalence is different from (and finer than) observation equivalence. In fact we prove that it coincides with the branching bisimulation equivalence of Van Glabbeek & Weijland. Also the back and forth variants of branching, η and delay bisimulation lead to branching bisimulation equivalence. The notion of back and forth bisimulation moreover leads to characterizations of branching bisimulation in terms of abstraction homomorphisms and in terms of Hennessy-Milner logic with backward modalities. In our view these results support the claim that branching bisimulation is a natural and important notion.","De Nicola, Rocco;Montanari, Ugo;Vaandrager, Frits",7004298169;7004968272;6701396047
10.1007/BFb0013030,75,"A methodology is introduced for defining truly concurrent semantics of processes as equivalence classes of Labelled Event Structures (LES). The construction of a les providing the operational semantics of systems consists of three main steps. First, systems are decomposed into sets of sequential processes and a set of rewriting rules is introduced which describe both the actions sequential processes may perform and their causal relation. Then, the rewriting rules are used to build an occurrence net. Finally, the required event structure is easily derived from the occurrence net. As a test case, a partial ordering operational semantics is introduced first for a subset of Milner's CCS and then for the whole calculus. The proposed semantics are consistent with the original interleaving semantics of the calculus and are able to capture all and only the parallelism present in its multiset semantics. In order to obtain more abstract semantic definitions, new notions of observational equivalence on Labelled Event Structures are introduced that preserve both concurrency and nondeterminism.","Degano, Pierpaolo;De Nicola, Rocco;Montanari, Ugo",7006345611;7004298169;7004968272
,33,"The problem of the relationship between truly concurrent operational and denotational semantics is tackled by mapping syntactic terms on similar semantic domains in both approaches. Occurrence nets are associated to terms through a structured operational semantics based on a set of rewriting rules; event structures are defined as denotations for terms, without resorting to categorical constructions. The proof of the equivalence of the two semantics relies on the direct correspondence between occurrence nets and event structures. R. Milner's (1980) calculus of communicating systems is used as a test case; truly concurrent denotational and operational semantics are given for it and proved consistent. This equivalence is established for the first time in true concurrency approach. It is proved that G. Winskel's (1982) categorical denotational semantics is equivalent to that given here.","Degano, Pierpaolo;De Nicola, Rocco;Montanari, Ugo",7006345611;7004298169;7004968272

In the presentation of each equivalence, the aspects of system behaviours which are ignored and the identifications which are forced will be stressed.

The operational semantics of the resulting language is simpler and the definition of testing preorders is significantly cleaner.

10.1016/j.technovation.2023.102878,0,"In today's business environment, New Product Development (NPD) teams play a pivotal role in propelling innovation. Within NPD teams, both successful and failed projects contribute in enhancing learning processes, yet the epistemological pathways activated by successful projects differ distinctly from those stimulated by failed projects. In this study, we investigate the pathways towards team learning in the context of successful and failed NPD projects using fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA). Drawing from the team learning literature, we examine which configurations of project characteristics (complexity and uncertainty), interpersonal team characteristics (innovation norms, cohesion, and decision-making autonomy), and environmental characteristics (technological and market turbulence) lead to NPD team learning. Our analysis identifies three configurations of factors tied to NPD team learning in successful projects and four configurations in failed projects. In successful projects, project and team characteristics are core in enhancing team learning. In failed projects, together with team characteristics, core conditions are represented by project complexity, uncertainty, while environmental characteristics play a dual role.","Balzano, Marco;Marzi, Giacomo",57216581144;57188549922
10.1016/j.indmarman.2023.08.002,1,"The ongoing paradigm shift towards two-sided and multi-sided platforms is reshaping business transactions and collaborations worldwide. Such digital platforms have found widespread acceptance in business-to-business markets, serving as catalysts for strategic networking, transparency, and traceability, especially in sourcing activities that demand strategic solutions for supplier selection and collaboration. Nonetheless, the variables influencing platform adoption in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large firms remain somewhat opaque. In this study, the social network theory (SNT), diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory, and technology–organisation–environment (TOE) framework were used as analytical lenses. Drawing from a sample of 318 responses from supply chain managers, this study employs a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to identify 15 configurations related to the adoption of two-sided platforms in both SMEs and large manufacturing firms. The results underscore that SMEs' drive for platform adoption is primarily anchored in their need for flexible, fluid networks, thus reinforcing the value of two-sided platforms in cultivating robust supplier relationships. In contrast, large firms are driven by potential advantages in efficiency and transactional security. However, the low adoption intention in both SMEs and large firms can be attributed to perceived barriers and a lack of perceived benefits, respectively.","Marzi, Giacomo;Marrucci, Anna;Vianelli, Donata;Ciappei, Cristiano",57188549922;57222293748;16319541600;8513137300

This study investigates the impact of BDA on strategic PSM decisions and how it interacts with a company's absorptive capacity. We conducted a survey of 222 purchasing and supply chain managers in international companies across various industries. Using structural equation modeling, we found that the exploration, assimilation, and transformation capabilities of purchasing departments are crucial in facilitating the use of BDA for strategic decision-making in PSM. Companies that excel in BDA in the PSM space are better equipped to capitalize on new and existing knowledge sources, which improves their performance. However, only businesses with the right resources can fully leverage BDA for high-level strategic decision-making; when BDA is applied to operational PSM activities, the desired effects may not be achieved.","Patrucco, Andrea S.;Marzi, Giacomo;Trabucchi, Daniel",57189071886;57188549922;56786351500
10.1016/j.technovation.2023.102803,0,"The proliferation of data-driven business models raises privacy concerns, as users often perceive a lack of transparency in how companies use their data. This study explores how business model transparency (and the absence of it) influences users' decisions to adopt a digital service. We propose a model grounded in rational choice theory, tested through multigroup structural equation modeling. Data were collected through a field experiment that exposed users to two different mock-ups characterized by varying levels of transparency related to data usage. The results show that the level of transparency does not directly influence users' willingness to adopt the service. Switching from a transparent to an opaque data-driven business model negatively affects users' willingness to adopt a service. Such findings remark on the users’ service adoption decision-making process criteria, which are highly influenced by perceived data usage transparency. Consequently, this study introduces a user perspective on data-driven business models. It conveys to managers the importance of transparency when business models are grounded in data-driven strategies and data exploitation.","Trabucchi, Daniel;Patrucco, Andrea S.;Buganza, Tommaso;Marzi, Giacomo",56786351500;57189071886;8330239700;57188549922

In this study, we examine how exogenous crises can constitute learning opportunities and assess their impact on firm survival. In particular, we investigate the role of learning in response to exogenous crises and how firm resilience, innovation capabilities, and environmental dynamism influence this relationship. Drawing from crisis management and organisational learning literature, we propose that these factors can bolster the connection between learning from crises and firm survival. To test our hypotheses, we conduct a nuanced analysis using both regression analysis and Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) on data from 249 Italian manufacturing Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). This approach allows us to simultaneously examine the impact of firm resilience, innovation capabilities, and environmental dynamism on the relationship between learning from crises and firm survival. Our findings offer theoretical and practical insights into the role of learning from crises in a firm's survival. They also highlight the importance of embracing learning opportunities in crisis situations and suggest that how firms deal with crises could be an opportunity to fine-tune their internal processes and thrive in the long run.","Kyrdoda, Yuliia;Balzano, Marco;Marzi, Giacomo",57397539400;57216581144;57188549922

Despite the growing body of research on digital transformation, there has been relatively little research on the microfoundational mechanisms that contribute to the successful digital transformation of workplaces. Drawing from the microfoundational perspective, this study examines managers' cognition regarding the digital transformation of the workplace, with a particular focus on how generational differences among managers influence such cognitions. To explore this topic, a case study was conducted using 25 semistructured interviews and field observations at a Dutch multinational enterprise. The findings identify key mechanisms related to digital transformation processes, highlighting how generational differences between managers belonging to Generation X and Generation Y necessitate efficient coordination to cope with organizational tensions and successfully pursue the digital transformation of workplaces. This coordination can be supported by orchestrating managers, a shared vision, and the development of a flexible paradigm.

10.1016/j.technovation.2022.102585,28,"The adoption of Open Innovation (OI) in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) often rests on its positive evaluation from top-management teams and/or entrepreneurs. Because of the mixed outcomes attainable through SMEs' openness, managers must weigh the beneficial aspects of boundary-spanning against the complexities coming from inter-organizational arrangements and knowledge transfer. Building upon the tenets of dual-process theory, this study highlights the cognitive configurations leading toward willingness or reluctance of OI adoption in SMEs. This is done by investigating perceptions of barriers, benefits, and organisational resistance to openness, such as the not-invented-here (NIH) and not-shared-here (NSH) syndromes in combination with decision-makers’ cognitive styles. To shed further light on observed heterogenous outcomes and the effects of managerial cognitive configurations, this study analyses the willingness and reluctance to adopt OI among 434 managers and entrepreneurs working in SMEs. The results of combined PLS-SEM and fsQCA analyses outline different decisional paths associated with willingness and reluctance to adopt OI. Thus, this research contributes to the ‘human side of OI’ paradigm by providing fruitful implications about cognitive configurations of decision-makers in SMEs concerning OI adoption.","Marzi, Giacomo;Fakhar Manesh, Mohammad;Caputo, Andrea;Pellegrini, Massimiliano Matteo;Vlačić, Božidar",57188549922;57214672488;55513877500;57040612400;57212764901

NFR is a comprehensive term that includes several forms of reporting, such as CSR reporting, integrated reporting (IR), SDG reporting, GRI reporting, and GHG reporting, among others. The lack of a common standard in NFR has generated discrepancies in NFR managerial practices around the globe. As a result, this study aims to summarise the various NFR practices and the evolution of NFR research by providing a review based on the most influential articles published between 2012 and 2020. We used bibliometric analysis to identify eight research areas: the content of non-financial reports, the IR framework, the relation of NFR with firm-level variables, the relationship between NFR and corporate governance, the theories behind NFR, NFR assurance, the relationship between institutional context and NFR, and environmental reporting. We propose a summary of the literature, together with the best managerial practices that have emerged in recent years.

The findings have been triangulated with documentation available on the corporate website, the project reports and direct observation. Data were analyzed using an inductive approach, coding individual interview transcripts. Findings: This study identifies three categories of capabilities that have to be spread to different organizational levels: the capability to sense organizational triggers to change, to develop external collaborations and knowledge exchanges with different parties and the management's ability to be aware of organizational imperatives and the need to proceed with process adjustment. Results highlight the importance of sensing organizational triggers, allowing a quick switch between new strategies in implementing an OI approach. It was crucial for the company to co-develop new products and services with a large audience of stakeholders, not only limited to customers.

Hereby, we performed a bibliometric analysis of 86 papers and a systematic literature review on the most influential papers belonging to the pertinent literature. Results show that a 4-cluster structure exists for sport entrepreneurship: its theoretical definitions and internal factors fostering it (cluster 1), environmental factors may foster it (cluster 2), pedagogical approaches and education (cluster 3), and finally its impacts, especially in terms of community development and social benefits (cluster 4). From these findings, a framework to help both scholars and practitioners approaching the topic was developed.","Pellegrini, Massimiliano M.;Rialti, Riccardo;Marzi, Giacomo;Caputo, Andrea",57040612400;57193703398;57188549922;55513877500

Leadership is a central element for knowledge creation, acquisition, utilization and integration processes. Based on these considerations, this study aims to offer an overview of the evolution of the literature regarding the knowledge management-leadership relationship published over the past 20 years. Design/methodology/approach: A bibliometric analysis coupled with a systematic literature review were performed over a data set of 488 peer-reviewed articles published from 1990 to 2018. Findings: The authors discovered the existence of four well-polarized clusters with the following thematic focusses: human and relational aspects, systematic and performance aspects, contextual and contingent aspects and cultural and learning aspects. The authors then investigated each thematic cluster by reviewing the most relevant contributions within them. Research limitations/implications: Based on the bibliometric analysis and the systematic literature review, the authors developed an interpretative framework aimed at uncovering several promising and little explored research areas, thus suggesting an agenda for future knowledge management-leadership research. Some steps of the paper selection process may have been biased by the interpretation of the researcher. The authors addressed this concern by performing a multiple human subject reading process whose reliability was confirmed by a Krippendorf’s alpha coefficient value >0.80.

However, in the managerial field, big data is now mainly used to support operational activities while its strategic potential is still largely unexploited. Based on these considerations, this study proposes an overview of the literature regarding the relationship between big data and business strategy. Design/methodology/approach: A bibliographic coupling method is applied over a dataset of 128 peer-reviewed articles, published from 2013 (first year when articles regarding the big data-business strategy relationship were published) to 2019. Thereafter, a systematic literature review is presented on 116 papers, which were found to be interconnected based on the VOSviewer algorithm. Findings: This study discovers the existence of four thematic clusters. Three of the clusters relate to the following topics: big data and supply chain strategy; big data, personalisation and co-creation strategies and big data, strategic planning and strategic value creation. The fourth cluster concerns the relationship between big data and KM and represents a ‘bridge’ between the other three clusters. Research limitations/implications: Based on the bibliometric analysis and the systematic literature review, this study identifies relevant understudied topics and research gaps, which are suggested as future research directions.

Integrating gamification into the workplace has been identified as a possible strategy to promote employee participation, engagement and loyalty. Gamification is defined as the application of game design elements in a non-game context, which, in this case, is the workplace. This article presents a 12-month longitudinal study designed to investigate the role of gamification in fostering job satisfaction and engagement. The findings from a sample of 398 employees, including both treatment and control groups from a large multinational company that introduced a gamified human resource management (HRM) system, revealed the effects of certain gamification experiential outcomes related to driving employee satisfaction and engagement at work.

10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.05.003,81,"This exploratory study investigates the relationship of plan-driven Stage-Gate and flexible Agile models with new product development performance through an original conceptualization that focuses on their underlying principles for managing uncertainty and the resulting changes. While Stage-Gate attempts to control uncertainty up-front to avoid later changes, Agile seeks to adapt to uncertainty and accommodate changes for a longer proportion of the development process. In addition, we examine the interaction effects of combining the two models. The analysis of survey data on 181 software developers shows that the adoption of Stage-Gate principles is negatively associated with speed and cost performance. For Agile, the use of sprints is positively related to new product quality, on-time and on-budget completion, while early and frequent user feedback would seem to prolong time-to-market. Finally, the results highlight a nuanced interaction between Stage-Gate and Agile, both positive and negative depending on the principles considered.","Bianchi, Mattia;Marzi, Giacomo;Guerini, Massimiliano",35101351800;57188549922;57201976747

10.1080/00207543.2019.1581953,9,"Excessive software development is the tendency to develop new software above and beyond the requirements of the market and/or planned specifications. It is a widespread phenomenon involving both risks and flexibility advantages. As it represents a challenging dilemma for software developers, it is important to study its human origins. Drawing on the tripartite model of individual attitudes, this study investigates the influence of developers’s cognitive (intuitive and rational thinking styles), affective (emotional attachment) and behavioural (reliance on past experiences) traits on two forms of excess, beyond needs and beyond plans. Using survey data on 307 software developers, this study shows that different manifestations of excess are associated with distinct traits of software developers. Emotional attachment drives beyond needs excess. A positive (negative) association is found between relying on past experiences and beyond needs excess (beyond plans excess). An intuitive cognitive style fosters the inclusion of extra features in the new product scope, whereas a rational style might lead to developing one-size-fits-all software that targets the needs of a broad user base. These findings contribute to research on the development of digital new products and production technologies by offering a comprehensive yet fine-grained picture of excessive software development’s nature and drivers.","Bianchi, Mattia;Marzi, Giacomo;Zollo, Lamberto;Patrucco, Andrea",35101351800;57188549922;57189575608;57189071886

10.1108/BPMJ-05-2017-0129,28,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the ways in which the geographical distance between headquarters and subsidiaries moderates the relationship between cultural intelligence and the knowledge transfer process. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 103 senior expatriate managers working in Croatia from several European and non-European countries was used to test the hypotheses. Data were collected using questionnaires, while the methodology employed to test the relationship between the variables was partial least square. Furthermore, interaction-moderation effect was utilized to test the impact of geographical distance and, for testing control variables, partial least square multigroup analysis was used. Findings: Cultural intelligence plays a significant role in the knowledge transfer process performance. However, geographical distance has the power to moderate this relationship based on the direction of knowledge transfer. In conventional knowledge transfer, geographical distance has no significant impact. On the contrary, data have shown that, in reverse knowledge transfer, geographical distance has a moderately relevant effect. The authors supposed that these findings could be connected to the specific location of the knowledge produced by subsidiaries. Practical implications: Multinational companies should take into consideration that the further away a subsidiary is from the headquarters, and the varying difference between cultures, cannot be completely mitigated by the ability of the manager to deal with cultural differences, namely cultural intelligence. Thus, multinational companies need to allocate resources to facilitate the knowledge transfer between subsidiaries. Originality/value: The present study stresses the importance of cultural intelligence in the knowledge transfer process, opening up a new stream of research inside these two areas of research.","Vlajcic, Davor;Marzi, Giacomo;Caputo, Andrea;Dabic, Marina",57190749414;57188549922;55513877500;6507123949

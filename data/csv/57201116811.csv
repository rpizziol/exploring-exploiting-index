10.1038/s41597-023-02080-8,6,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all domains of human life, including the economic and social fabric of societies. One of the central strategies for managing public health throughout the pandemic has been through persuasive messaging and collective behaviour change. To help scholars better understand the social and moral psychology behind public health behaviour, we present a dataset comprising of 51,404 individuals from 69 countries. This dataset was collected for the International Collaboration on Social & Moral Psychology of COVID-19 project (ICSMP COVID-19). This social science survey invited participants around the world to complete a series of moral and psychological measures and public health attitudes about COVID-19 during an early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (between April and June 2020). The survey included seven broad categories of questions: COVID-19 beliefs and compliance behaviours; identity and social attitudes; ideology; health and well-being; moral beliefs and motivation; personality traits; and demographic variables. We report both raw and cleaned data, along with all survey materials, data visualisations, and psychometric evaluations of key variables.","Azevedo, Flavio;Pavlović, Tomislav;Rêgo, Gabriel G.;Ay, F.

To this purpose we exploited unique data from a quasi-experiment involving about two thousand students, one thousand participating (the treatment group) and one thousand not participating (the control group) in the program. Data were collected by means of a survey that we specifically designed and implemented to record students’ self-reported behaviors. Our estimates indicate that the program has been successful: the students in the program reported an increase in efficient water usage and an increase in the frequency of discussions with their parents about water usage; moreover, positive effects were still observed after six months. Our findings suggest that game-based educational programs can be an effective instrument to promote practices supporting sustainable water use behaviors in students and their parents.","Bilancini, Ennio;Boncinelli, Leonardo;Di Paolo, Roberto",24175889200;24175528900;57201116811
10.1073/pnas.2219676120,0,"In a world severely put under stress by COVID-19, generosity becomes increasingly essential both when able to transcend local boundaries, building upon universalistic values, and when directed toward more local contexts, such as the native country. This study aims to investigate an underresearched determinant of generosity at these two levels, a factor that captures one’s beliefs, values, and opinions about society: political ideology. We study the donation decisions of more than 46,000 participants from 68 countries in a task with the possibility of donating to a national charity and an international one. We test whether more left-leaning individuals display higher generosity in general (H1) and toward international charities (H2). We also examine the association between political ideology and national generosity without hypothesizing any direction. We find that more left-leaning individuals are more likely to donate in general and more likely to be generous internationally. We also observe that more right-leaning individuals are more likely to donate nationally. These results are robust to the inclusion of several controls. In addition, we address a relevant source of cross-country variation, the quality of governance, which is found to have significant informative power in explaining the relationship between political ideology and the different types of generosity. Potential mechanisms underlying the resulting behaviors are discussed.","Pizziol, Veronica;Demaj, Xhiselda;Paolo, Roberto Di;Capraro, Valerio",57226799439;58172620000;57201116811;49361021300

Raising awareness on these challenges can importantly contribute to the sustainable development of all countries.

10.1177/10468781231181652,0,"Background: In a world increasingly stressed by climate change and scarcity of natural resources, the prosocial behaviors of new generations become increasingly essential, especially when aimed at sustainability. This study aims to investigate the gamified system applied to the game-based educational program BLUTUBE, designed to promote better practices regarding virtuous water usage in the primary schools of the Municipality of Lucca. Methods: We analyze the self-reported sustainable behaviors of almost 800 students of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th grades, using a survey about water consumption and awareness of related topics. We examine the association between the increase in the self-reported prosocial behaviors, which occurs after the end of the educational program, and participation in different activities - measured by the number of accumulated points - stimulated through gamification. Results: We find that higher participation in gamified activities corresponds more likely to a higher increase in reported sustainable behaviors. Moreover, we observe that this result is led by specific activities - playing the board game Blutube at school, playing the urban game, and taking pictures of virtuous actions - rather than others - playing the board game at home. Lastly, given the difference between genders in the perceived benefits from gamification, we find that males increase more their awareness about sustainable behaviors by playing more the board game than females. In contrast, females raise their awareness when playing the urban game more. Discussion: We suggest that playing the board game in a broader social context, such as school, can enhance the perception of children’s behaviors’ impacts on the external environment. Also, to effectively promote sustainable behaviors, educators should consider using game-based learning materials that incorporate rewards mechanisms into the activities. Conclusions: This work sheds light on the relationship between gamification and pro-environmental behaviors, laying the ground for future research.","Di Paolo, Roberto;Pizziol, Veronica",57201116811;57226799439
10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115438,4,"The impact of COVID-19 represents a specific challenge for voluntary transfusional systems sustained by the intrinsic motivations of blood donors. In general, health emergencies can stimulate altruistic behaviors. However, in this context, the same prosocial motivations, besides the personal health risks, could foster the adherence to social distancing rules to preserve collective health and, therefore, discourage blood donation activities. In this work, we investigate the consequences of the pandemic shock on the dynamics of new donors exploiting the individual-level longitudinal information contained in administrative data on the Italian region of Tuscany. We compare the change in new donors' recruitment and retention during 2020 with respect to the 2017–2019 period (we observe 9511 individuals), considering donors’ and their municipalities of residence characteristics. Our results show an increment of new donors, with higher proportional growth for older donors. Moreover, we demonstrate that the quality of new donors, as proxied by the frequency of subsequent donations, increased with respect to previous years. Finally, we show that changes in extrinsic motivations, such as the possibility of obtaining a free antibody test or overcoming movement restrictions, cannot explain the documented increase in the number of new donors and in their performance. Therefore, our analyses indicate that the Tuscan voluntary blood donation system was effective in dealing with the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bilancini, Ennio;Boncinelli, Leonardo;Di Paolo, Roberto;Menicagli, Dario;Pizziol, Veronica;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Serti, Francesco",24175889200;24175528900;57201116811;57199647974;57226799439;8565770200;26022647900

10.1038/s41467-021-27668-9,182,"Changing collective behaviour and supporting non-pharmaceutical interventions is an important component in mitigating virus transmission during a pandemic. In a large international collaboration (Study 1, N = 49,968 across 67 countries), we investigated self-reported factors associated with public health behaviours (e.g., spatial distancing and stricter hygiene) and endorsed public policy interventions (e.g., closing bars and restaurants) during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic (April-May 2020). Respondents who reported identifying more strongly with their nation consistently reported greater engagement in public health behaviours and support for public health policies. Results were similar for representative and non-representative national samples. Study 2 (N = 42 countries) conceptually replicated the central finding using aggregate indices of national identity (obtained using the World Values Survey) and a measure of actual behaviour change during the pandemic (obtained from Google mobility reports). Higher levels of national identification prior to the pandemic predicted lower mobility during the early stage of the pandemic (r = −0.40). We discuss the potential implications of links between national identity, leadership, and public health for managing COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Van Bavel, Jay J.;Cichocka, Aleksandra;Capraro, Valerio;Sjåstad, Hallgeir;Nezlek, John B.;Pavlović, Tomislav;Alfano, Mark;Gelfand, Michele J.;Azevedo, Flavio;Birtel, Michèle D.;Cislak, Aleksandra;Lockwood, Patricia L.;Ross, Robert Malcolm;Abts, Koen;Agadullina, Elena;Aruta, John Jamir Benzon;Besharati, Sahba Nomvula;Bor, Alexander;Choma, Becky L.;Crabtree, Charles David;Cunningham, William A.;De, Koustav;Ejaz, Waqas;Elbaek, Christian T.;Findor, Andrej;Flichtentrei, Daniel;Franc, Renata;Gjoneska, Biljana;Gruber, June;Gualda, Estrella;Horiuchi, Yusaku;Huynh, Toan Luu Duc;Ibanez, Augustin;Imran, Mostak Ahamed;Israelashvili, Jacob;Jasko, Katarzyna;Kantorowicz, Jaroslaw;Kantorowicz-Reznichenko, Elena;Krouwel, André;Laakasuo, Michael;Lamm, Claus;Leygue, Caroline;Lin, Ming Jen;Mansoor, Mohammad Sabbir;Marie, Antoine;Mayiwar, Lewend;Mazepus, Honorata;McHugh, Cillian;Minda, John Paul;Mitkidis, Panagiotis;Olsson, Andreas;Otterbring, Tobias;Packer, Dominic J.;Perry, Anat;Petersen, Michael Bang;Puthillam, Arathy;Riaño-Moreno, Julián C.;Rothmund, Tobias;Santamaría-García, Hernando;Schmid, Petra C.;Stoyanov, Drozdstoy;Tewari, Shruti;Todosijević, Bojan;Tsakiris, Manos;Tung, Hans H.;Umbreș, Radu G.;Vanags, Edmunds;Vlasceanu, Madalina;Vonasch, Andrew;Yucel, Meltem;Zhang, Yucheng;Abad, Mohcine;Adler, Eli;Akrawi, Narin;Mdarhri, Hamza Alaoui;Amara, Hanane;Amodio, David M.;Antazo, Benedict G.;Apps, Matthew;Ay, F.

,0,"Escape from the Castle is a digital escape game created with the collaboration of the Museum of Saving in Turin (Italy), Neuroscience Lab Intesa Sanpaolo Innovation Center, and the GAME Science Research Center of IMT School for Ad-vanced Studies Lucca. In the escape game, players must help Mica, the mascot of the Museum, to run away from the Ghost of the Baroness, from its Castle. To do that, every player has to solve four puzzles in four different rooms. Each room is correlated to a financial issue, such as saving strategies and planning. The game aims to increase the awareness that money represents a means for achieving a purpose (i.e., use value of money) and not an end, from a behavioural and neuroscientific point of view. So we built a study about the behaviour of teenagers. According to the literature, the cooperative approach proposes emotional and cognitive involvement as a tool to strengthen learning, increases awareness of self-efficacy and, when applied to money management, increases the self-perception of being able to make consumption choices. To better understand the mechanisms of cooperation, we built an experiment with 118 students from eleven to fourteen years old, that played the game during a visit to the Museum. We divided students into two groups: one in which students could collaborate with each other in solving the puzzles (treatment) and one in which they had to play individually (control), and we collected score and time of play (behavioural data). In each group, two students wore eye-trackers to record pupil dilation to collect neurophysiological data. Here we present mainly the behavioural results that show that the students who were allowed to collaborate obtained, on average, double the score compared to those who played individually. Furthermore, those who collaborated finished the game in less time than those who have not played as a group. Moreover, combining behavioural data with neurophysiological data, there are indications that high pupil dilation is correlated with high engage-ment in play, and this is often true in collaborating groups.","Bisanti, Matteo;Di Paolo, Roberto;Pizziol, Veronica;Accardi, Sebastiano;Maggi, Francesca;Paladino, Giovanna;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Bilancini, Ennio",26026262000;57201116811;57226799439;57951273700;57232266500;6603147464;8565770200;24175889200
,13,"In this paper we investigate the effect of moral suasion on ingroup favouritism. We report a well-powered, pre-registered, two-stage 2x2 mixed-design experiment. In the first stage, groups are formed on the basis of how participants answer a set of questions, concerning non-morally relevant issues in one treatment (assorting on non-moral preferences), and morally relevant issues in another treatment (assorting on moral preferences). In the second stage, participants choose how to split a given amount of money between participants of their own group and participants of the other group, first in the baseline setting and then in a setting where they are told to do what they believe to be morally right (moral suasion). Our main results are: (i) in the baseline, participants tend to favour their own group to a greater extent when groups are assorted according to moral preferences, compared to when they are assorted according to non-moral preferences; (ii) the net effect of moral suasion is to decrease ingroup favouritism, but there is also a non-negligible proportion of participants for whom moral suasion increases ingroup favouritism; (iii) the effect of moral suasion is substantially stable across group assorting and four pre-registered individual characteristics (gender, political orientation, religiosity, pro-life vs pro-choice ethical convictions).","Bilancini, Ennio;Boncinelli, Leonardo;Capraro, Valerio;Celadin, Tatiana;Di Paolo, Roberto",24175889200;24175528900;49361021300;57216634436;57201116811

Our results confirm the recent literature that downplays the link between 2D:4D and many domains of economic interest, such as social and risk preferences. As for the former, we find that social preferences are significantly lower when 2D:4D is above the median value only for subjects with low cognitive ability. As for the latter, we find that a high 2D:4D is not correlated with the frequency of subjects’ risky choices.","Alonso, Judit;Di Paolo, Roberto;Ponti, Giovanni;Sartarelli, Marcello",57201120630;57201116811;7005854240;57110388700

In both experiments, we used the same materials presenting a manipulation on person features: second person plural pronouns and plural definite determiners alternate in introducing a full NP (“it was [DP1 the/you [NP bankers]]i that [DP2 the/you [NP lawyers]] have avoided _i at the party”) in a language, Italian, with overt person (and number) subject-verb agreement. As results, we first observed that the advantage of the bare pronominal forms reported in previous experiments (Gordon et al., 2001; Warren and Gibson, 2005, a.o.) is lost when the full NP (the “lexical restriction” in Belletti and Rizzi, 2013) is present. Second, an advantage for the mismatch condition, Art1-Pro2, in which the focalized subject is introduced by the determiner and the OC subject by the pronoun, as opposed to the matching Pro1-Pro2 condition, is observed, both off-line (higher acceptability and accuracy in answering comprehension questions after eyetracking) and on-line (e.g., smaller number of regressions from the subject region); third, we found a relevant difference between acceptability and accuracy in comprehension questions: despite similar numerical patterns in both off-line measures, the difference across conditions in accuracy is mostly not significant, while it is significant in acceptability. Moreover, while the matching condition Pro1-Pro2 is perceived as nearly ungrammatical (far below the mean acceptability across-conditions), the accuracy in comprehension is still high (close to 80%). To account for these facts, we compare different formal competence and processing models that predict difficulties in OC constructions: similarity-based (Gordon et al., 2001, a.o.), memory load (Gibson, 1998), and intervention-based (Friedmann et al., 2009) accounts are compared to processing oriented ACT-R-based predictions (Lewis and Vasishth, 2005) and to top-down Minimalist derivations (Chesi, 2015). We conclude that most of these approaches fail in making predictions able to reconcile the competence and the performance perspective in a coherent way to the exception of the top-down model that is able to predict correctly both the on-line and the off-line main effects obtained. © Copyright © 2019 Chesi and Canal.","complexity; cue-based retrieval; intervention; memory load; object cleft; pronominal determiners; similarity; top-down derivation","","Aho A.V., Ullman J.D., The theory of parsing, translation, and compiling, Parsing, 1, (1972); Anderson J.R., Human symbol manipulation within an integrated cognitive architecture, Cogn.

Pronouns either matched the gender provided by role nouns (such as ""king"" or ""engineer"") or did not. We compared two types of gender information, definitional information, which is semantic in nature (a mother is female), or stereotypical (a nurse is likely to be female). When they followed definitional role-nouns, gender-mismatching pronouns elicited a P600 effect reflecting a failure in the agreement process. When instead the gender violation occurred after stereotypical role-nouns the Event Related Potential response was biphasic, being positive in parietal electrodes and negative in anterior left electrodes. The use of a correlational approach showed that those participants with more ""feminine"" or ""expressive"" self sex-role descriptions showed a P600 response for stereotype violations, suggesting that they experienced the mismatch as an agreement violation; whereas less ""expressive"" participants showed an Nref effect, indicating more effort spent in linking the pronouns with the possible, although less likely, counter-stereotypical referent. © 2015 Canal, Garnham and Oakhill.","Electrophysiology of language comprehension; Gender stereotypes, anaphor processing; Individual differences; Nref; P600; Social perception of gender","","Baayen R.H., Davidson D.J., Bates D.M., Mixed-effects modeling with crossed random effects for subjects and items, J.

Yet we know very little about the role of ToM in real-time processing of metaphors in neurotypical adults. Here, we tested the relationship between ToM and metaphor through Event Related Potentials (ERPs) by capitalizing on the difference between metaphors inviting inferences on physical (Boxers are pandas) vs. mental aspects (Teachers are books). Physical metaphors involved a larger and sustained negativity compared to mental ones. This pattern resembled concreteness effects and suggests that physical metaphors may benefit from both verbal and perceptual information. Moreover, higher scores in the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), but not in the Animation task, were associated with a reduction of the N400 amplitude for both physical and mental metaphors. When exploring the ERP temporal trajectory with Generalized Additive Mixed Modeling, earlier differences between metaphors characterized individuals with higher RMET scores. Among the various ToM components, thus, emotion recognition seems to be involved in the processing of metaphors in general, with an earlier impact on the mental type. These findings highlight the multifaceted nature of metaphor, at the crossroad of language, social and perceptual experience. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","ERP; Experimental Pragmatics; Metaphor; Neuropragmatics; Reading the Mind in the Eyes; Theory of Mind","Adult; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials; Female; Humans; Language; Male; Metaphor; Theory of Mind; adult; article; boxer; controlled study; emotion; event related potential; female; human; human experiment; language; literature; male; role theory; teacher; theory of mind; electroencephalography; evoked response","Abell F., Happe F., Frith U., Do triangles play tricks?

While theoretical linguistics has largely described the phenomenon of presupposition, there is little empirical investigation, mainly from behavioural studies. Here we employed the Event Related Potential (ERP) technique to search for the brain signature of presupposition as opposed to assertion in discourse. Based on theoretical accounts, we hypothesized that presupposing new information should elicit higher efforts due to the mismatch between the information packaging and the actual knowledge, and to the need of accommodating the presupposed content in the mental model of discourse. We also hypothesized that these efforts could reflect in enhanced N400, similarly to other mechanisms operating at the discourse-context level. Twenty-seven participants were presented with passages containing new information packaged either as presupposition or as assertion. Two types of presupposition triggers were selected: definite descriptions and temporal subordinate clauses. Results evidenced a difference between the processing of presuppositions and that of assertions, reflected in a more enhanced N400 for the former. Results also showed that the temporal development of the presupposition effect is earlier for subordinate clauses than for definite descriptions. Differently from some behavioural studies on presupposition, but consistently with the theoretical literature and with other ERP studies on discourse processing, our data offer the first neurophysiological evidence that presupposition is more costly than assertion when new information is presented, with differences in the time development of the effect across trigger types. We proposed to account for the N400 effect induced by new presuppositions as stemming from a pragmatic “garden path” effect, in that, being presented with a new presupposition, the receiver is led down a mismatch between information packaging and discourse representation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Discourse; Experimental pragmatics; Information structure; N400; Neuropragmatics","","Abbott B., Presuppositions as non assertions, Journal of Pragmatics, 32, pp. 1419-1437, (2000); Abusch D., Lexical alternatives as source of pragmatic presuppositions, Proceedings of SALT XII, (2002); Altmann G.T.M., Anticipating the garden path: The horse raced past the barn ate the cake, Language down the garden path: The cognitive and biological basis for linguistic structure, pp. 111-130, (2013); Bambini V., Neuropragmatics: A foreword, Italian Journal of Linguistics, 22, 1, pp. 1-20, (2010); Bambini V., Bara B., Neuropragmatics, Handbook of pragmatics, pp. 1-22, (2012); Bambini V., Bertini C., Schaeken W., Stella A., Di Russo F., Disentangling metaphor from context: An ERP study, Frontiers in Psychology, 7, (2016); Bambini V., Resta D., Grimaldi M., A dataset of metaphors from the Italian literature: Exploring psycholinguistic variables and the role of context, PLoS ONE, 9, (2014); Bever T.G., The cognitive basis for linguistic structures, Cognition and the development of language, pp. 279-362, (1970); Bornkessel-Schlesewsky I., Schumacher P.B., Towards a neurobiology of information structure, The oxford handbook of information structure, (2016); Burkhardt P., The P600 reflects cost of new information in discourse memory, Neuroreport, 18, 17, pp. 1851-1854, (2007); Burkhardt P., Roehm D., Differential effects of saliency: An event-related brain potential study, Neuroscience Letters, 413, pp. 115-120, (2007); Camblin C.C., Gordon P.C., Swaab T.Y., The interplay of discourse congruence and lexical association during sentence processing: Evidence from ERPs and eye tracking, Journal of Memory and Language, 56, 1, pp. 103-128, (2007); Cory B., Romoli J., Schwarz F., Crain S., Scalar implicatures vs. presuppositions: The view from acquisition, TOPOI: Presuppositions: Philosophy, Linguistics, and Psychology, 35, 1, pp. 57-71, (2016); Coulson S., Frame-shifting and frame semantics: Joke comprehension on the space structuring model, Cognitive linguistics and humor research, pp. 167-190, (2015); Delorme A., Makeig S., EEGLAB: An open source toolbox for analysis of single-trial EEG dynamics including independent component analysis, Journal of Neuroscience Methods, 134, pp. 9-21, (2004); Domaneschi F., Carrea E., Penco C., Greco A., The cognitive load of presupposition triggers: Mandatory and optional repairs in presupposition failure, Language, Cognition and Neuroscience, 29, 1, pp. 136-146, (2014); Domaneschi F., Carrea E., Penco C., Greco A., Selecting presuppositions in conditional clauses.

Participants read ambiguous idiom strings embedded in highly predictable, literal, and idiomatic contexts while their EEG was recorded. Control sentences only contained the idiom-final word whose cloze values were as high as in literal and idiomatic contexts. Event-related potentials data showed that differences in the amplitude of a frontal positivity (PNP) emerged at the beginning and at the end of the idiom strings, with the idiomatic context condition associated with more positive voltages. The time frequency analysis of the EEG showed an increase in power of the middle gamma frequency band only in the literal context condition. These findings suggest that sentence revision mechanisms, associated with the frontal PNP, are involved in idiom meaning integration, and that the literal semantic composition of the idiomatic constituents, associated with changes in gamma frequency, is not carried out after idiom recognition. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Configuration hypothesis; ERPs; Frontal PNP; Meaning integration in idioms; Middle gamma frequency band","Adolescent; Analysis of Variance; Anticipation, Psychological; Brain; Comprehension; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials; Female; Humans; Linguistics; Male; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Reading; Young Adult; adolescent; analysis of variance; anticipation; brain; comprehension; electroencephalography; evoked response; female; human; linguistics; male; pattern recognition; physiology; reading; young adult","Arnon I., Snider N., More than words: Frequency effects for multi-word phrases, Journal of Memory and Language, 62, pp. 67-82, (2010); Bastiaansen M.C.M., Mazaheri A., Jensen O., Beyond ERPs: Oscillatory neuronal dynamics, The Oxford handbook of event-related potential components, pp. 31-50, (2012); Bobrow S.A., Bell S.M., On catching on to idiomatic expressions, Memory & Cognition, 1, pp. 343-346, (1973); Bohrn I.C., Altmann U., Jacobs A.M., Looking at the brains behind figurative language-A quantitative meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies on metaphor, idiom, and irony processing, Neuropsychologia, 50, pp. 2669-2683, (2012); Bornkessel-Schlesewsky I., Philipp M., Alday P.M., Kretzschmar F., Grewe T., Gumpert M., ..

Results showed that, for both types, the accommodation of presuppositions is associated with a biphasic N400-P600 pattern at the processing point. With definite descriptions, we observed a more clear involvement of the N400, while for change-of-state verbs the costs of accommodation were associated with a more pronounced P600. Moreover, when conveyed by change of state predicates, presuppositions seem to elicit also a P200 visible already at the trigger verb. The data nicely fit into the Linking-Updating model and support two main conclusions. First, presupposition accommodation is a sequential process unfolding through a biphasic ERP pattern presumably related to search for antecedent and discourse update. Second, the kind of presupposition trigger seems to affect the cognitive cost of presupposition accommodation at different processing times, with definite description capitalizing more on the earlier search for antecedent and change-of-state verbs capitalizing more on the later updating of the discourse mental model with the presupposed information. Overall, our findings suggest that the brain understands information taken for granted by going through a process whose time course involves several phases, differently modulated based on specific linguistic expressions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Experimental pragmatics; Linking and updating; N400; Neuropragmatics; P200; P600; Presupposition","accommodation; accuracy; adult; alpha rhythm; amplitude modulation; Article; cognition; event related potential; female; hemisphere; human; human experiment; male; neuromodulation; neurophysiology; normal human; prediction; priority journal; satisfaction; semantics; stimulus response; task performance","Amaral P., Cummins C., A cross-linguistic study on information backgrounding and presupposition projection, Experimental perspectives on presuppositions, pp. 157-172, (2015); Arnold J.E., Wasow T., Losongco A., Heaviness vs. newness: The effects of structural complexity and discourse status on constituent ordering, Language, 76, pp. 28-55, (2000); Baayen R.H., Davidson D.J., Bates D.M., Mixed-effects modelling with crossed random effects for subjects and items, Journal of Memory and Language, 59, 4, pp. 390-412, (2008); Baayen R.H., Milin P., Analyzing reaction times, International Journal of Psychological Research, 3, 2, pp. 12-28, (2010); Bambini V., Bertini C., Schaeken W., Stella A., Di Russo F., Disentangling metaphor from context: An ERP study, Frontiers in Psychology, 7, (2016); Bambini V., Resta D., Metaphor and experimental pragmatics: When theory meets empirical investigation, Humana.

However, little is known about the emotional response to tragedy-triggered humor, let alone Covid-19 humor. With a large-scale survey completed during the early stages of Italy's lockdown, we studied the appreciation (funniness and aversiveness) of different formats of Covid-19 humor shared on social media. Results of an analysis of the role of demographic, personality, and psychological distance factors with linear mixed models showed that Covid-19 humor lacks a “signature” of funniness, but displays a mark of aversiveness. Among demographics, age and gender were key factors: with increasing age and in women, Covid-19 humor was judged as more aversive. Individuals using humor to cope with uneasy circumstances judged Covid-19 humor as funnier and less aversive. Furthermore, the perceived risk of infection amplified Covid-19 humor aversiveness, while kilometrical distance from the first Italian contagion hotspot raised the amusement in global terms. These findings expand our knowledge about dark humor and should raise awareness of the great variation in the emotional impact of Covid-19 humor and of the need to ponder where and with whom to share the laugh about the pandemic. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Coping; Covid-19 humor; Dark humor; Humor appreciation; Internet humor; Psychological distance","","Aillaud M., Piolat A., Influence of gender on judgment of dark and nondark humor, Individ.

This chapter largely focus on these two kinds of expressions. It outlines the major findings in monolingual research on non-literal language processing that employed event-related potentials (ERPs). The chapter reviews a handful of ERP studies that have looked at bilingual figurative language processing and highlight the need for further research. It first discusses a number of theories put forward to account for non-literal language representation and access in a first language (L1), as well as some of the pertinent studies with second language (L2) speakers. It provides a discussion on the ERP methodology and, specifically, the ERP components implicated in non-literal language processing. Finally, the chapter reviews a selection of ERP studies on figurative language processing in monolingual participants, before turning to the studies on non-literal language processing in bilingual populations. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

However, very few experiments have tackled the neurophysiological underpinnings of literary metaphor. Here we used Event-Related brain Potentials (ERPs) to explore the temporal dynamics of comprehending metaphors from Italian poems and novels (e.g., grass of velvet), presented in their original context, as compared with literal expressions (e.g., throne of velvet). Results evidence a more negative ERP response for metaphors, unfolding in an N400 followed by a sustained negativity over frontal sites, suggesting a long-lasting effort in elaborating figurative meanings. Whereas the N400 might be indicative of lexical/semantic processes typical of metaphors and amplified by the literary context, the sustained negativity might reflect the manipulation of multiple meanings in working memory, possibly responsible for the poetic effect. Interestingly, the late negativity effect is driven by familiarity, with a more negative response for those metaphors that are less familiar. These findings offer material to discuss ideas put forward in pragmatics, literary studies, and cognitive neuroscience of literature, like the condensation of weak implicatures, the foregrounding, and the relation between a metaphor and its context. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","Arzouan Y., Goldstein A., Faust M., Brainwaves are stethoscopes: ERP correlates of novel metaphor comprehension, Brain Research, 60, pp. 69-81, (2007); Baayen R.H., Davidson D.J., Bates D.M., Mixed-effects modeling with crossed random effects for subjects and items, Journal of Memory and Language, 59, pp. 390-412, (2008); Baayen R.H., Milin P., Analyzing reaction times, International Journal of Psychological Research, 3, pp. 12-28, (2010); Baggio G., Van Lambalgen M., Hagoort P., Computing and recomputing discourse models: An ERP study, Journal of Memory and Language, 52, pp. 36-53, (2008); Bambini V., Neuropragmatics: A foreword, Italian Journal of Linguistics, 22, pp. 1-20, (2010); Bambini V., Bertini C., Schaeken W., Stella A., Di Russo F., Disentangling metaphor from context: An ERP study, Frontiers in Psychology, 7, (2016); Bambini V., Gentili C., Ricciardi E., Bertinetto P.M., Pietrini P., Decomposing metaphor processing at the cognitive and neural level through functional magnetic resonance imaging, Brain Research Bulletin, 86, pp. 203-216, (2011); Bambini V., Ghio M., Moro A., Schumacher P.B., Differentiating among pragmatic uses of words through timed sensicality judgments, Frontiers in Psychology, 4, (2013); Bambini V., Resta D., Metaphor and experimental pragmatics: When theory meets empirical investigation, Humana.

Using linear mixed models on single trials we showed that humorous target words elicited a larger Left Anterior Negativity (LAN), sustained in time and followed by a positive shift involving P600 and Late Positive Complex (LPC) components. In the time-frequency domain, humor was associated with a power decrease in the beta-band of the EEG. Furthermore, participants’ Autism-spectrum Quotient correlated with the size of the LAN, suggesting that social skills may affect humor comprehension during the early processing phase. Our results describe a sequence of events where incongruity detection (associated with the LAN) precedes a composite set of mechanisms serving resolution and acting in parallel: the sustained LAN might reflect the search for an alternative script, while the P600 might index inferential processes arriving at the resolution and the updating of the discourse model. The processing differences associated with the LPC and the changes in beta power may reflect a later stage of more elaborative and reflective processing (where the receiver reflects upon the joke's solution) and the abandonment of the current discourse model. © 2019","ERP; Experimental pragmatics; Humor and jokes; Neuropragmatics; Time-frequency","Adolescent; Adult; Brain; Comprehension; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials; Female; Humans; Male; Reading; Wit and Humor as Topic; Young Adult; adult; Article; autism assessment; comprehension; controlled study; conversation; electroencephalogram; electrophysiology; emotion; event related potential; female; human; human experiment; humor; language processing; male; priority journal; questionnaire; sentence span task; social competence; stimulus response; time factor; verbal memory test; visual stimulation; working memory; adolescent; brain; electroencephalography; evoked response; physiology; reading; young adult","Attardo S., Linguistic theories of humor.

We present a qualitative, non-exhaustive, review of several empirical investigations that used EEG-based measures to investigate language processing in the pragmatic domain. Touching upon three main topics (non-literal language, discourse and conversation, and clinical populations), we present the interaction of a set of cognitive processes that exploit semantic memory or elaborate on the mental representation of the current context to derive pragmatic inferences. ERP measures provide evidence for shedding new light on longstanding debates in pragmatics (e.g., the direct vs. indirect access issue), while a pragmatic perspective provides information on the functional role of ERP components (e.g., to understand the nature of the P600 in non-syntactic contexts). © 2023, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Context;

Typically, CCPs are formed by a first preposition (P1) followed by a content word (N1) and a second, final preposition (P2) (in the - P1 - hands - N1 - of - P2). Despite their default structure stored in semantic memory, some CCPs allow internal modification (e.g., adjective insertion). In this study, two experiments tested the comprehension of CCPs in which we modified their default structure inserting an adjective before the noun. This modification preserved the semantic well-formedness of the string. The self-paced reading time study (Experiment 1) showed that readers took significantly longer to read the CCP constituents after the inserted adjective (N1 and P2). The ERP (Experiment 2) showed a smaller N400 response to the noun when preceded by the adjective, suggesting that the insertion did not disrupt the online processing of the CCP. Critically, the adjective insertion increased the processing load of the prepositional phrase introduced by the CCP, as evidenced by a LAN in response to the complement noun (N2). Overall, these findings showed that processing CCPs was not disrupted by insertions despite their predefined default word order. Rather, their interpretation was semantically enriched, correlating with an increase in the processing load when the CCP was integrated with the complement noun. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Collocational complex prepositions; LAN; N400; Sentence processing","adult; article; automation; collocational complex preposition; comprehension; event related potential; female; human; long term memory; male; priority journal; reading; semantic memory; semantics; word recognition","Anderson J.E., Holcomb P.J., An electrophysiological investigation of the effects of coreference on word repetition and synonymy, Brain and Language, 94, 2, pp. 200-216, (2005); Arnon I., Snider N., More than words: Frequency effects for multi-word phrases, Journal of Memory and Language, 62, pp. 67-82, (2010); Baayen R.H., Analyzing linguistic data.

Grounding in theoretical pragmatics, we developed a novel metaphor comprehension training (MetaCom) for school-age children that focuses on inferential and contextual aspects of metaphors. The effects of the MetaCom were tested against a control training focusing on text comprehension in a randomized controlled trial involving 55 children aged between 8;8 and 9;8. Only children in the MetaCom group improved in the ability to verbally explain the meaning of a metaphor. Moreover, only the MetaCom showed transfer effects to reading comprehension. These findings suggest that targeting inference and attention to context is key to promote metaphor understanding, and that the benefits might extend to linguistic and communicative skills at large. The MetaCom training can thus represent a promising tool for educational programs, possibly also in atypical populations. © The Author(s) 2022.","experimental pragmatics; figurative language; Metaphor; pragmatics; relevance theory; training","","Baayen R.H., Analyzing linguistic data: A practical introduction to statistics using R, (2008); Bambini V., Ghio M., Moro A., Schumacher P.B., Differentiating among pragmatic uses of words through timed sensicality judgments, Frontiers in Psychology, 4, (2013); Bambini V., Tonini E., Ceccato I., Lecce S., Marocchini E., Cavallini E., How to improve social communication in aging: Pragmatic and cognitive interventions, Brain and Language, 211, (2020); Bambini V., Bott L., Schumacher P.B., It is not always a matter of time: Addressing the costs of metaphor and metonymy through a speed-accuracy trade-off study, Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology/Revue canadienne de psychologie expérimentale, 75, 2, pp. 189-196, (2021); Bambini V., Agostoni G., Buonocore M., Tonini E., Bechi M., Ferri I., Sapienza J., Martini F., Cuoco F., Cocchi F., Bischetti L., Cavallaro R., Bosia M., It is time to address language disorders in schizophrenia: A RCT on the efficacy of a novel training targeting the pragmatics of communication (PragmaCom), Journal of Communication Disorders, (2022); Bates D.M., Kliegl R., Vasishth S., Baayen H., Parsimonious mixed models, arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.04967, pp. 1-27, (2015); Benjamin L., Newton C., Ebbels S., Investigating the effectiveness of idiom intervention for 9–16-year-olds with developmental language disorder, International Journal of Language & Communication Disorders, 55, 2, pp. 266-286, (2020); Bialecka-Pikul M., Teaching children to understand metaphors as a path leading to theory of mind development, European Journal of Developmental Psychology, 7, 5, pp. 529-544, (2010); Bos L.T., De Koning B.B., Wassenburg S.I., van der Schoot M., Training inference making skills using a situation model approach improves reading comprehension, Frontiers in Psychology, 7, (2016); Bowes A., Katz A., Metaphor creates intimacy and temporarily enhances theory of mind, Memory and Cognition, 43, 6, pp. 953-963, (2015); Boyce W., Torsheim T., Currie C., Zambon A., The family affluence scale as a measure of national wealth: Validation of an adolescent self-report measure, Social Indicators Research, 78, 3, pp. 473-487, (2006); Brock J., Norbury C., Einav S., Nation K., Do individuals with autism process words in context?

However, most of the studies consider major standard languages, such as English, Dutch, Spanish or Italian. This is a limitation, since these languages display relatively simple systems that are fairly stable and do not allow to address language variation and change. Here we investigated gender agreement in a dialect of Southern Italy spoken in Agnone, using Event-Related Potentials. Compared with Italian and most standard Romance languages, the Agnonese gender system is more complex (with three target genders: feminine, masculine, neuter) and, also under the pressure of standard Italian, undergoing change, with the neuter merging into the masculine. Results showed that all determiner-noun gender mismatches elicited robust P600 and moderate Left Anterior Negativity (LAN) effects. Yet not all violations involving neuter nouns were equally outright. For masculine-neuter, the amplitude of the P600 was less pronounced than for feminine-neuter violations. Moreover, when looking at individual differences, the P600 for masculine-neuter was progressively reduced as participants’ competence in the Agnonese conservative variety decreased. Since sociolinguistics shows that individual variation within the speech community may reflect linguistic change, the smaller P600 exhibited by less conservative speakers could be described as a brain signature of ongoing language change in the Agnonese gender system. In other words, the attenuation of ungrammaticality-driven brain responses may provide a measurable indicator of the fading of the neuter and its merging into the masculine. This work paves the way to the neurolinguistic description of non-standard varieties and also breaks ground for a “diachronic neurolinguistics”, extending investigation into the neurobiology of language beyond the synchronic dimension. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agreement; Diachronic neurolinguistics; ERP; Language change; Romance dialects","adult; article; controlled study; electroencephalogram; event related potential; female; gender; human; human experiment; Italy; language; male; neurobiology; speech","Baayen R.H., Milin P., Analyzing reaction times, International Journal of Psychological Research, 3, 2, pp. 12-28, (2010); Bambini V., Bertini C., Schaeken W., Stella A., Di Russo F., Disentangling metaphor from context: An ERP study, Frontiers in Psychology, 7, (2016); Bambini V., Canal P., Neurolinguistic research on the Romance languages, The Oxford encyclopedia of romance linguistics, pp. 1-24, (2021); Bambini V., Trevisan M., EsploraCoLFIS: Un'interfaccia Web per ricerche sul Corpus e Lessico di Frequenza dell'Italiano Scritto, Quaderni Del Laboratorio Di Linguistica Della Scuola Normale Superiore, 11, pp. 1-16, (2012); Barber H., Carreiras M., Grammatical gender and number agreement in Spanish: An ERP comparison, Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 17, 1, pp. 137-153, (2005); Barr D.J., Levy R., Scheepers C., Tily H.J., Random effects structure for confirmatory hypothesis testing: Keep it maximal, Journal of Memory and Language, 68, 3, pp. 255-278, (2013); Bates D., Machler M., Bolker B., Walker S., Fitting linear mixed-effects models using lme4, Journal of Statistical Software, 67, 1, pp. 1-48, (2015); Bice K., Kroll J.F., Grammatical processing in two languages: How individual differences in language experience and cognitive abilities shape comprehension in heritage bilinguals, Journal of Neurolinguistics, 58, (2021); Bickel B., Witzlack-Makarevich A., Choudhary K.K., Schlesewsky M., Bornkessel-Schlesewsky I., The neurophysiology of language processing shapes the evolution of grammar: Evidence from case marking, PloS One, 10, 8, (2015); Bisang W., Luming W., Bornkessel-Schlesewsky I., Subjecthood in Chinese.

SNEGs belong to the class of expletive negation sentences, i.e., they are affirmative in meaning but involve a clausal negation. A clear example is offered by Italian: ‘Enonmi è scesa dal treno Maria?!’ (let. ‘and not CLITIC.to_me is got off-the train Mary’ = ‘The surprise was that Maria got off the train!’). From a theoretical point of view, the interpretation of SNEGs as affirmative can be derived from their specific syntactic and semantic structure. Here we offer an implementation of the visual world paradigm to test how SNEGs are interpreted. Participants listened to affirmative, negative or expletive negative clauses while four objects (two relevant—either expected or unexpected—and two unrelated) were shown on the screen and their eye movements were recorded. Growth Curve Analysis showed that the fixation patterns to the relevant objects were very similar for affirmative and expletive negative sentences, while striking differences were observed between negative and affirmative sentences. These results showed that negation does play a different role in the mental representation of a sentence, depending on its syntactic derivation. Moreover, we also found that, compared to affirmative sentences, SNEGs require higher processing efforts due to both their syntactic complexity and pragmatic integration, with slower response time and lower accuracy. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Expletive negation;

At an electrophysiological level, this cognitive function contributes substantially in determining the amplitude of the N400. In fact, the amplitude of the N400 towords within a sentence has been shown to depend on how predictable those words are: The more predictable a word, the smaller the N400 elicited. However, predictive processing can be based on different sources of information that allow anticipation of upcoming constituents and integration in context. In this study, we investigated the ERPs elicited during the comprehension of idioms, that is, prefabricated multiword strings stored in semantic memory. When a reader recognizes a string of words as an idiombefore the idiom ends, she or he can develop expectations concerning the incoming idiomatic constituents. We hypothesized that the expectations driven by the activation of an idiommight differ from those driven by discourse-based constraints. To this aim, we compared the ERP waveforms elicited by idioms and two literal control conditions. The results showed that, in both cases, the literal conditions exhibited amore negative potential than the idiomatic condition. Our analyses suggest that before idiom recognition the effect is due to modulation of the N400 amplitude, whereas after idiom recognition a P300 for the idiomatic sentence has a fundamental role in the composition of the effect. These results suggest that two distinct predictive mechanisms are at work during language comprehension, based respectively on probabilistic information and on categorical template matching. © 2009 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","","Analysis of Variance;

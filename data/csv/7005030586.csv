10.1016/j.automatica.2023.111411,0,"In safety-critical applications that rely on the solution of an optimization problem, the certification of the optimization algorithm is of vital importance. Certification and suboptimality results are available for a wide range of optimization algorithms. However, a typical underlying assumption is that the operations performed by the algorithm are exact, i.e., that there is no numerical error during the mathematical operations, which is hardly a valid assumption in a real hardware implementation. This is particularly true in the case of fixed-point hardware, where computational inaccuracies are not uncommon. This article presents a certification procedure for the proximal gradient method for box-constrained QP problems implemented in fixed-point arithmetic. The procedure provides a method to select the minimal fractional precision required to obtain a certain suboptimality bound, indicating the maximum number of iterations of the optimization method required to obtain it. The procedure makes use of formal verification methods to provide arbitrarily tight bounds on the suboptimality guarantee. We apply the proposed certification procedure on the implementation of a non-trivial model predictive controller on 32-bit fixed-point hardware.","Krupa, Pablo;Inverso, Omar;Tribastone, Mirco;Bemporad, Alberto",57205380533;55608826400;15123357400;7005030586
10.1016/j.conengprac.2023.105769,0,"This paper proposes a real-time motion planning scheme for safe human–robot workspace sharing relying on scenario-based nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), a well-known approach for solving stochastic NMPC problems. A scenario tree is generated via higher-order Markov chains to provide probabilistic predictions of the human motion. Scenario-based NMPC is then used to generate point-to-point motions of the robot manipulator based on the above-mentioned human motion predictions, accounting for safety constraints via speed and separation monitoring (SSM). This means that the robot speed is always modulated to be able to stop before a possible collision with the human occurs. After proving theoretical properties on recursive feasibility and closed-loop stability of the proposed motion planning strategy, this is tested experimentally on a Kinova Gen3 robot interacting with a human operator, showing superior performance with respect to an NMPC scheme not relying on human predictions and to a fixed-path SSM strategy.","Oleinikov, Artemiy;Soltan, Sergey;Balgabekova, Zarema;Bemporad, Alberto;Rubagotti, Matteo",57195555281;57218837036;57945206200;7005030586;24725558700

Models derived from fundamental physical principles may fail to capture the complexity of the actual system dynamics. A potential solution is the use of a physics-informed, or gray-box model that extends a physics-based model with a data-driven part. Learning the latter might be challenging, due to noisy measurements and lack of full state information. This work presents a method based on Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) for simultaneous state estimation and training of a black-box submodel, such as a neural network. The method can be used in offline training or applied online for adaptation without any prior knowledge than the white-box submodel. We analyze the capabilities of the method in a two degree of freedom robotic manipulator case study, also showing how it can be used for online adaptation to cope with a time-varying model mismatch.","Løwenstein, Kristoffer Fink;Bernardini, Daniele;Fagiano, Lorenzo;Bemporad, Alberto",58525029900;26421940500;16177541200;7005030586
10.1007/s10589-023-00502-2,0,"Optimization problems that include regularization functions in their objectives are regularly solved in many applications. When one seeks second-order methods for such problems, it may be desirable to exploit specific properties of some of these regularization functions when accounting for curvature information in the solution steps to speed up convergence. In this paper, we propose the SCORE (self-concordant regularization) framework for unconstrained minimization problems which incorporates second-order information in the Newton-decrement framework for convex optimization. We propose the generalized Gauss–Newton with Self-Concordant Regularization (GGN-SCORE) algorithm that updates the minimization variables each time it receives a new input batch. The proposed algorithm exploits the structure of the second-order information in the Hessian matrix, thereby reducing computational overhead. GGN-SCORE demonstrates how to speed up convergence while also improving model generalization for problems that involve regularized minimization under the proposed SCORE framework. Numerical experiments show the efficiency of our method and its fast convergence, which compare favorably against baseline first-order and quasi-Newton methods. Additional experiments involving non-convex (overparameterized) neural network training problems show that the proposed method is promising for non-convex optimization.","Adeoye, Adeyemi D.;Bemporad, Alberto",57383593600;7005030586

Most of them generate C code for easy implementation on a microcontroller, and the others can convert the C code into hardware description language code for implementation on a field programmable gate array (FPGA). However, a unified tool allowing one to generate efficient embedded MPC for an FPGA, starting from the definition of the plant and its constraints, was still missing. The MOBY-DIC2 toolbox described in this brief bridges this gap. To illustrate its functionalities, the tool is exploited to embed the controller and observer for a real buck power converter in an FPGA.

10.1109/TAC.2023.3241238,0,"—This article proposes a novel coordinate-descent augmented-Lagrangian (CDAL) solver for linear, possibly parameter-varying, model predictive control (MPC) problems. At each iteration, an augmented Lagrangian (AL) subproblem is solved by coordinate descent (CD), exploiting the structure of the MPC problem. The CDAL solver enjoys three main properties: 1) it is construction-free, in that it avoids explicitly constructing the quadratic programming problem associated with MPC; 2) is matrix-free, as it avoids multiplications and factorizations of matrices; and 3) is library-free, as it can be simply coded without any library dependency, 90-lines of C-code in our implementation. To favor the convergence speed, CDAL employs a reverse cyclic rule for the CD method, the accelerated Nesterov’s scheme for updating the dual variables, a simple diagonal preconditioner, and an efficient coupling scheme between the CD and AL methods. We show that CDAL competes with other state-of-the-art methods, both in the case of unstable linear time-invariant and linear parameter-varying prediction models.","Wu, Liang;Bemporad, Alberto",57275400900;7005030586

Arbitrary convex and twice-differentiable loss functions and regularization terms are handled by sequential least squares and either a line-search (LS) or a trust-region method of Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) type for ensuring convergence. In addition, to handle non-smooth regularization terms such as ℓ1, ℓ0, and group-Lasso regularizers, as well as to impose possibly non-convex constraints such as integer and mixed-integer constraints, we combine sequential least squares with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We call the resulting algorithm NAILS (nonconvex ADMM iterations and least squares) in the case line search (LS) is used, or NAILM if a trust-region method (LM) is employed instead. The training method, which is also applicable to feedforward neural networks as a special case, is tested in three nonlinear system identification problems.","Bemporad, Alberto",7005030586

These benefits, however, come at the expense of an optimization problem that is no longer the typical quadratic programming problem derived from most linear MPC formulations due to the inclusion of a particular class of second-order cone constraints. This article presents a method for efficiently dealing with these constraints in operator splitting methods, leading to a computation time for solving HMPC in line with state-of-the-art solvers for linear MPC. We show how to apply this result to the alternating direction method of the multipliers algorithm, presenting a solver that we compare against other solvers from the literature, including solvers for other linear MPC formulations.

10.1109/TAC.2022.3187853,0,"Linear models with additive unknown-but-bounded input disturbances are extensively used to model uncertainty in robust control system design. Typically, the disturbance set is either assumed to be known a priori or estimated from data through set-membership identification. However, the problem of computing a suitable input disturbance set in case the set of possible output values is assigned a priori has received relatively little attention. This problem arises in many contexts, such as in supervisory control, actuator design, decentralized control, and others. In this article, we propose a method to compute input disturbance sets (and the corresponding set of states) such that the resulting set of outputs matches as closely as possible a given set of outputs, while additionally satisfying strict (inner or outer) inclusion constraints. We formulate the problem as an optimization problem by relying on the concept of robust invariance.

We prove that PARC is a block-coordinate descent algorithm that minimizes a suitably constructed objective function and that it converges in a finite number of steps. The algorithm is used to learn hybrid numerical/categorical dynamical models from data that contain real and discrete labeled values. The resulting model has a piecewise linear structure that is particularly useful to formulate model predictive control problems and solve them by mixed-integer programming.","Bemporad, Alberto",7005030586

We tackle the optimization problem using an implicit RPI set approach that provides a priori approximation error guarantees, and adopt a novel disturbance set parameterization that permits the encoding of the set of feasible disturbance sets as a polyhedron.

First-order methods are suitable as they can deal with such large-scale problems, but may perform poorly and fail to converge within a reasonable number of iterations. To achieve a fast rate of convergence and high solution speeds, in this article, we propose the use of two proximal quasi-Newtonian limited-memory algorithms—minfbe applied to the dual problem and the Newton-type alternating minimization algorithm (nama)—which can be massively parallelized on lockstep hardware such as graphics processing units. In particular, we use minfbe and nama to solve scenario-based stochastic optimal control problems with affine dynamics, convex quadratic cost functions (with the stage cost functions being strongly convex in the control variable) and joint state-input convex constraints.

10.1109/LCSYS.2023.3284763,0,"Economic MPC (EMPC) optimizes closed-loop performance by directly minimizing a given objective function, as opposed to Tracking MPC (TMPC) which instead penalizes deviations from a precalculated optimal reference. The main difference between the two approaches can be observed during transients, as the former always acts optimally, while the latter is only optimal when the reference is accurately tracked. Unfortunately, stability for EMPC is in general difficult to prove, as opposed to TMPC which builds on a rich theory. Additionally, many efficient algorithms are available for TMPC, while solving the EMPC problem can be much harder. In prior works, a family of discrete-time TMPC schemes that provide approximate economic optimality has been developed in order to partially overcome these issues In this letter, we aim at extending such a family of TMPC schemes to the continuous time case. Similarly to the discrete-time case, also in continuous-time we obtain a first-order approximation of the EMPC control law. We demonstrate the theory with a numerical example that confirms the first-order approximation and we show that our continuous-time formulation can be made equivalent to the discrete-time one.","Facchino, Matteo;Bemporad, Alberto;Zanon, Mario",57223622764;7005030586;55375650900
10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3282842,0,"The combination of model predictive control (MPC) and learning methods has been gaining increasing attention as a tool to control systems that may be difficult to model. Using MPC as a function approximator in reinforcement learning (RL) is one approach to reduce the reliance on accurate models. RL is dependent on exploration to learn, and currently, simple heuristics based on random perturbations are most common. This paper considers variance-based exploration in RL geared towards using MPC as function approximator. We propose to use a non-probabilistic measure of uncertainty of the value function approximator in value-based RL methods. Uncertainty is measured by a variance estimate based on inverse distance weighting (IDW). The IDW framework is computationally cheap to evaluate and therefore well-suited in an online setting, using already sampled state transitions and rewards. The gradient of the variance estimate is then used to perturb the policy parameters in a direction where the variance of the value function estimate is increasing. The proposed method is verified on two simulation examples, considering both linear and nonlinear system dynamics, and compared to standard exploration methods using random perturbations.","Seel, Katrine;Bemporad, Alberto;Gros, Sebastien;Gravdahl, Jan Tommy",57215528178;7005030586;55694310100;6603609139

The proposed algorithm asks the agents at each iteration first to fit a surrogate function to local samples, and subsequently to minimize, in a cooperative fashion, an acquisition function, in order to generate new samples to query. In this letter we build the acquisition function as the sum of the local surrogates, in order to exploit the knowledge of these estimates, plus another term that drives the minimization procedure towards unexplored regions of the feasible space, where better values of the objective function might be present.

10.1016/j.ejcon.2022.100647,1,"In various classification problems characterized by a large number of features, feature selection (FS) is essential to guarantee generalization capabilities. The FS problem is often ill-posed due to significant correlations among features, which may lead to several different feature subsets with comparable scores in terms of classification performance. However, not all these subsets are equivalent from a domain-oriented point of view due to known relationships among features and their different acquisition costs in production to deploy the trained classifier. In this paper, we consider the potential benefits of including the domain expert's preferences in the FS task, thus integrating both objective elements (e.g., classification accuracy) and subjective (often not quantifiable) considerations in the selection process. This goes in the direction of increasing the interpretability and the trustworthiness of the machine learning model, which is an often desired property in many application domains such as in medicine. The proposed method consists of an iterative procedure. At each iteration, the expert is asked to express a “human” preference on pairs of classifiers, each one trained from a different subset of features. The expressed preferences are used algorithmically to update a suitable surrogate function that mimics the latent subjective expert's objective function, and then to propose a new classifier for testing and comparison.

The algorithm described in this paper aims at reaching the global optimizer by iteratively proposing the decision maker a new comparison to make, based on actively learning a surrogate of the latent (unknown and perhaps unquantifiable) objective function from past sampled decision vectors and pairwise preferences. A radial-basis function surrogate is fit via linear or quadratic programming, satisfying if possible the preferences expressed by the decision maker on existing samples. The surrogate is used to propose a new sample of the decision vector for comparison with the current best candidate based on two possible criteria: minimize a combination of the surrogate and an inverse weighting distance function to balance between exploitation of the surrogate and exploration of the decision space, or maximize a function related to the probability that the new candidate will be preferred. Compared to active preference learning based on Bayesian optimization, we show that our approach is competitive in that, within the same number of comparisons, it usually approaches the global optimum more closely and is computationally lighter.

Ignoring the effect of noise on the observations of the scheduling signals may lead to a bias in the final estimate and, as a consequence, also to an incorrect selection of the model order. In this paper, we introduce a “bias-corrected cost function” for the identification of LPV systems from noise-corrupted observations of the output and scheduling variable. The introduced cost function provides a bias-free parameter estimation along with model order selection. The proposed identification approach has two main advantages: (i) the problem of model order selection can be handled by adding a LASSO-like penalty term to the bias-corrected cost function; (ii) it provides a bias-free cost as a criterion to tune some hyper-parameters influencing the final parameter estimate.","Mejari, Manas;Piga, Dario;Bemporad, Alberto",56100053100;35791353300;7005030586

We distinguish between different driving modes including adaptive cruise control (ACC) and obstacle avoidance (OA) for the handling of dynamic driving situations. We further assume that any controllable vehicle is equipped with proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors for environment perception within a particular range field.

10.1109/TAC.2015.2417851,46,"Model predictive control (MPC) is one of the most successful techniques adopted in industry to control multivariable systems under constraints on input and output variables. To circumvent the main drawback of MPC, i.e., the need to solve a Quadratic Program (QP) on line to compute the control action, explicit MPC was proposed in the past to precompute the control law off line using multiparametric QP (mpQP). The resulting form of the MPC law is piecewise affine, which is extremely easy to code, can be computed online by simple arithmetic operations, and requires a maximum number of iterations that can be exactly determined a priori. On the other hand, the offline computations to solve the mpQP problem require detecting emptiness, full-dimensionality, and minimal hyperplane representations of polyhedra, and other computational geometric operations. While most of the existing methods solve such operations via linear programming, the approach proposed in this paper relies on a nonnegative least squares (NNLS) solver that is very simple to code and fast to execute. In addition, the new approach exploits QP duality to identify and construct critical regions and to handle degeneracy issues.","Bemporad, Alberto",7005030586

Operating, safety and quality constraints deem it important for the state and the input of such systems to be constrained into a given domain. Moreover, DWNs' operation is driven by time-varying demands and involves an considerable consumption of electric energy and the exploitation of limited water resources. Hence, the management of these networks must be carried out optimally with respect to the use of available resources and infrastructure, whilst satisfying high service levels for the drinking water supply. To accomplish this task, this paper explores various methods for demand forecasting, such as Seasonal ARIMA, BATS and Support Vector Machine, and presents a set of statistically validated time series models.

Usual control approaches for hybrid nets can be divided into discrete-time and continuous-time approaches. Continuous-time approaches are usually more precise, but can be computationally prohibitive. Discrete-time approaches are less complex, but can entail mode-mismatch errors due to fixed time discretization. This work proposes an optimization-based event-driven control approach that applies on continuous time models and where the control actions change when discrete events occur. Such an approach is computationally feasible for systems of interest in practice and avoids mode-mismatch errors.

By using quadratic programming, SMPCL can handle, in general, larger state dimension models than stochastic dynamic programming, and can reconfigure in real-time for accommodating changes in driver behavior. The SMPCL approach is demonstrated in the energy management of a series hybrid electrical vehicle, aimed at improving fuel efficiency while enforcing constraints on battery state of charge and power. The SMPCL controller allocates the power from the battery and the engine to meet the driver power request. A Markov chain that models the power request dynamics is learned in real-time to improve the prediction capabilities of model predictive control (MPC).

The performance of the conventional air-to-fuel ratio feedback loop is limited by the combustion delay between fuel injection and engine exhaust, and by the transport delay for the exhaust gas to propagate to the air-to-fuel ratio sensor location. The combined delay is variable, since it depends on engine speed and airflow. Drivability, fuel economy and emission requirements result in constraints on the deviations of the air-to-fuel ratio, stored oxygen in the three-way catalyst, and fuel injection. This paper proposes an approach for air-to-fuel ratio control based on Model Predictive Control (MPC). The approach systematically handles both variable time delays and pointwise-in-time constraints. A delay-free model is considered first, which takes into account the dynamic relations between the injected fuel and the air-to-fuel ratio and the dynamics of the oxygen stored in the catalyst. For the delay-free model, the explicit MPC law is computed. Delay compensation is obtained by estimating the delay online from engine operating conditions, and feeding the MPC law with the state predicted ahead over the time interval of the estimated delay. The predicted state is computed by combining measurement filtering with forward iterations of the nonlinear dynamic equations of the model.

In this paper, we develop a model predictive control (MPC) strategy for regulating the engine speed to the idle speed set-point by actuating the electronic throttle and the spark timing. The MPC controller coordinates the two actuators according to a specified cost function, while explicitly taking into account constraints on the control and requirements on the acceptable engine speed range, e.g., to avoid engine stalls. Following a process proposed here for the implementation of MPC in automotive applications, an MPC controller is obtained with excellent performance and robustness as demonstrated in actual vehicle tests. In particular, the MPC controller performs better than an existing baseline controller in the vehicle, is robust to changes in operating conditions, and to different types of disturbances.

The performance of the conventional air-to-fuel ratio feedback loop is limited by the combustion delay between fuel injection and engine exhaust, and by the transport delay for the exhaust gas to propagate to the air-to-fuel ratio sensor location. The combined delay is variable, since it depends on engine speed and airflow. Drivability, fuel economy and emission requirements result in constraints on the deviations of the air-to-fuel ratio, stored oxygen in the three-way catalyst, and fuel injection. This paper proposes an approach for air-to-fuel ratio control based on Model Predictive Control (MPC). The approach systematically handles both variable time delays and pointwise-in-time constraints. A delay-free model is considered first, which takes into account the dynamic relations between the injected fuel and the air-to-fuel ratio and the dynamics of the oxygen stored in the catalyst. For the delay-free model, the explicit MPC law is computed. Delay compensation is obtained by estimating the delay online from engine operating conditions, and feeding the MPC law with the state predicted ahead over the time interval of the estimated delay. The predicted state is computed by combining measurement filtering with forward iterations of the nonlinear dynamic equations of the model. The achieved performance in tracking the air-to-fuel ratio and the oxygen storage setpoints while enforcing the constraints is demonstrated in simulation using real data profiles.

Modern MIP solvers are on the other hand highly efficient at taking advantage of problem structure and usually achieve average optimization times that are much better than the worst case predicts. But as the MIP constraints depend on the current state of the plant, complexity can vary considerably and unpredictable behavior can occur. To circumvent unpredictability and to be able to enforce hard real-time computation constraints, the number of feasible nodes in the MIP problem is limited online by adding constraints to the number of possible mode sequences over the prediction horizon. It is shown that in realistic scenarios concerning control of large scale sewer networks, depending on the value of parameters related to the mode sequence constraints (MSC), drastic reductions can be achieved in optimization time.

Based on a previous feasibility study, we implement a control architecture in which the MPC optimizes only the dynamics of the mechanical subsystem, and we test it in closed-loop simulations with the nonlinear system. The resulting control system achieves lower performance, but it is simple enough to be implemented in an automotive microcontroller. © 2007 IEEE.","Cairano, Stefano Di;Bemporad, Alberto;Kolmanovsky, Ilya;Hrovat, Davor",8698022800;7005030586;7006937254;35576827600

This paper takes a view that model predictive control (MPC) and hybrid models can be an attractive and systematic methodology to handle these challenging control problems, even when the underlying process is not hybrid. In addition, the piecewise affine (PWA) explicit form of MPC solutions avoids on-line optimization and can make this approach computationally viable even in situations with rather constrained computational resources.

We first consider a linear MPC design for the mechanical part of the system. The approach accounts for all the constraints in the system but one, which is subsequently enforced via a state-dependent saturation element. Second, a hybrid MPC approach for the mechanical subsystem is analysed that can handle all the constraints by design and achieves better performance, at the price of a higher complexity of the controller.

Considering that a quarter-car semi-active suspension can either be modeled as a linear system with state dependent constraint on control (of actuator force) input, or a bilinear system with a control (of variable damping coefficient) saturation, the seemingly simple problem poses several interesting questions and challenges. Does the optimal control law derived from the corresponding un-constrained system, i.e. ""clipped-optimal"", remain optimal for the constrained case? If the optimal control law of the constrained system does deviate from its un-constrained counter-part, how different are they? What is the structure of the optimal control law? In this paper, we attempt to answer some of the above questions by utilizing the recent development in model predictive control (MPC) of hybrid dynamical systems. The constrained quarter-car semi-active suspension is modeled as a switching affine system, where the switching is determined by the activation of passivity constraints, force saturation, and maximum power dissipation limits. Theoretically, over an infinite prediction horizon the MPC controller corresponds to the exact optimal controller. The performance of different finite-horizon hybrid MPC controllers is tested in simulation using mixed-integer quadratic programming. Then, for short-horizon MPC controllers, we derive the explicit optimal control law and show that the optimal control is piecewise affine in state. In particular, we show that for horizon equal to one the explicit MPC control law corresponds to clipped LQR. We will compare the derived optimal control law to various semi-active control laws in the literature including the well-known ""clipped-optimal"".

According to ideas from set-membership identification, the key approach is to characterize the model by its maximum allowed prediction error, which is used as a tuning knob for trading off between prediction accuracy and model complexity. At initialization, the proposed procedure for PWA identification exploits a technique for partitioning an infeasible system of linear inequalities into a (possibly minimum) number of feasible subsystems. This provides both an initial clustering of the datapoints and a guess of the number of required submodels, which therefore is not fixed a priori. A refinement procedure is then applied in order to improve both data classification and parameter estimation.

The reason for this interest is that the solution to mp-QP is a piecewise affine function of the state vector and thus it is easily implementable on-line. The main drawback of solving mp-QP exactly is that whenever the number of linear constraints involved in the optimization problem increases, the number of polyhedral cells in the piecewise affine partition of the parameter space may increase exponentially. In this paper we address the problem of finding approximate solutions to mp-QP, where the degree of approximation is arbitrary and allows to trade off between optimality and a smaller number of cells in the piecewise affine solution.","Bemporad, Alberto;Filippi, Carlo",7005030586;7006884051
10.1109/acc.2001.945973,23,"The paper discusses a framework for modeling, analyzing and controlling systems whose behavior is governed by interdependence physical laws, logic rules, and operating constraints, denoted as Mixed Logical Dynamical (MLD) systems. They are described by linear dynamic equations subject to linear inequalities involving real and integer variables. MLD models are equivalent to various other system descriptions like Piece-wise Affine (PWA) systems and Linear Complementarity (LC) systems. They have the advantage, however, that many problems of system analysis (like reachability/controllability, observability, and verification) and many problems of synthesis (like controller design and filter design) can be readily expressed as mixed integer linear or quadratic programs, for which many commercial software packages exist. In this paper we first recall MLD models and the modeling language HYSDEL (HYbrid Systems DEscription Language). Subsequently, we illustrate the use of Model Predictive Control (MPC) based on mixed-integer programming for hybrid MLD models, and the use of multiparametric programming for obtaining explicitly the equivalent piecewise linear control form of MPC. The eventual practical success of these methods will depend on progress in the development of the various optimization algorithms and tools so that problems of realistic size can be tackled.","Bemporad, A.;Morari, M.",7005030586;35564051100

For discrete-time linear time-invariant systems with constraints on inputs and states, we develop an algorithm to determine explicitly the state feedback control law associated with MPC, and show that it is piecewise linear and continuous. The controller inherits all the stability and performance properties of MPC, but the online computation is reduced to a simple linear function evaluation instead of the expensive quadratic program.

,110,"In this paper we propose a procedure for synthesizing piecewise linear optimal controllers for hybrid systems and investigate conditions for closed-loop stability. Hybrid systems are modeled in discrete-time within the mixed logical dynamical (MLD) framework [8], or, equivalently [7], as piecewise affine (PWA) systems. A stabilizing controller is obtained by designing a model predictive controller (MPC), which is based on the minimization of a weighted 1/∞-norm of the tracking error and the input trajectories over a finite horizon. The control law is obtained by solving a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) which depends on the current state. Although efficient branch and bound algorithms exist to solve MILPs, these are known to be NP-hard problems, which may prevent their on-line solution if the sampling-time is too small for the available computation power. Rather than solving the MILP on line, in this paper we propose a different approach where all the computation is moved off line, by solving a multiparametric MILP (mp-MILP). As the resulting control law is piecewise affine, on-line computation is drastically reduced to a simple linear function evaluation.

10.1007/3-540-46430-1_8,93,"In this paper, we formulate the problem of characterizing the stability of a piecewise affine (PWA) system as a verification problem. The basic idea is to take the whole Rn as the set of initial conditions, and check that all the trajectories go to the origin. More precisely, we test for semi-global stability by restricting the set of initial conditions to an (arbitrarily large) bounded set X(0), and label as “asymptotically stable in T steps” the trajectories that enter an invariant set around the origin within a finite time T, or as “unstable in T steps” the trajectories which enter a set Xinst of (very large) states. Subsets of X(0) leading to none of the two previous cases are labeled as “non-classifiable in T steps”. The domain of asymptotical stability in T steps is a subset of the domain of attraction of an equilibrium point, and has the practical meaning of collecting the initial conditions from which the settling time to a specified set around the origin is smaller than T. In addition, it can be computed algorithmically in finite time. Such an algorithm requires the computation of reach sets, in a similar fashion as what has been proposed for verification of hybrid systems. In this paper we present a substantial extension of the verification algorithm presented in [6] for stability characterization of PWA systems, based on linear and mixedinteger linear programming. As a result, given a set of initial conditions we are able to determine its partition into subsets of trajectories which are asymptotically stable, or unstable, or non-classifiable in T steps.","Bemporad, Alberto;Torrisi, Fabio Danilo;Morari, Manfred",7005030586;55881507300;35564051100

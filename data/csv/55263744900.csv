It is shown how Lyapunov recursions can be used to efficiently compute the tensor-valued cumulants of the transient- and limit distributions of stochastic linear systems. This analysis is based on the assumption that the process noise distribution admits a moment expansion but, apart from this, all derivations and numerical algorithms are kept entirely general - without introducing any further assumptions on the distribution. Moreover, it is shown both theoretically and numerically how to exploit these recursions to construct accurate approximations of a rather general class of stochastic optimal control problems for linear discrete-time systems with conditional-value-at-risk constraints.","Gao, Xvting;Villanueva, Mario E.;Houska, Boris",57791385100;55263744900;23008711800

Moreover, an analysis technique based on supermartingales is proposed, leading to stochastic stability results for a large class of distributionally robust controllers. In this context, we also discuss how to construct terminal cost functions for stochastic and distributionally robust MPC that ensure closed-loop stability and asymptotic convergence to robust invariant sets.

This has the advantage that methods from the field of spectral analysis can be used to characterize globally optimal control laws. A numerical method for constructing optimal feedback laws for nonlinear systems proceeds by computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix that is obtained by projecting the Pontryagin–Koopman operator onto a finite dimensional space. We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach by computing accurate approximations of the optimal nonlinear feedback law for a Van der Pol control system, which cannot be stabilized by a linear control law.","Villanueva, Mario Eduardo;Jones, Colin N.;Houska, Boris",55263744900;25021018100;23008711800

10.1137/140976807,13,"Many set-valued integration algorithms for parametric ordinary differential equations (ODEs) implement a combination of Taylor series expansion with either interval arithmetic or Taylor model arithmetic. Due to the wrapping effect, the diameter of the solution-set enclosures computed with these algorithms typically diverges to infinity on finite integration horizons, even though the ODE trajectories themselves may be asymptotically stable. This paper starts by describing a new discretized set-valued integration algorithm that uses a predictor-validation approach to propagate generic affine set-parameterizations, whose images are guaranteed to enclose the ODE solution set. Sufficient conditions are then derived for this algorithm to be locally asymptotically stable, in the sense that the computed enclosures are guaranteed to remain stable on infinite time horizons when applied to a dynamic system in the neighborhood of a locally asymptotically stable periodic orbit (or equilibrium point). The key requirement here is quadratic Hausdorff convergence of function extensions in the chosen affine set-parameterization, which is proved to be the case, for instance, for Taylor models with ellipsoidal remainders. These stability properties are illustrated with the case study of a cubic oscillator system.","Houska, Boris;Villanueva, Mario E.;Benoît, Chachuat",23008711800;55263744900;15759305000

This paper presents a method for the systematic construction of ellipsoidal extensions of factorable functions. It proceeds by lifting the ellipsoid to a higher dimensional space for every atom operation in the function's directed acyclic graph, thereby accounting for dependencies. We present theoretical results regarding the quadratic Hausdorff convergence of the computed enclosures. Moreover, we propose an efficient implementation, whereby the shape matrix of the lifted ellipsoid is stored in sparse format, and every atom operation corresponds to a sparse update in that matrix. We illustrate these developments with two numerical examples.","Villanueva, M. E.;Rajyaguru, J.;Houska, B.;Chachuat, B.",55263744900;55765389500;23008711800;15759305000

The focus is on discrete-time set-propagation algorithms that proceed by first constructing a predictor of the reachable set and then determine a step-size for which this predictor yields a valid enclosure. For asymptotically stable systems, we give general conditions under which the computed bounds are stable, at least for small enough parametric variations.

10.1109/CDC.2013.6759928,16,"This paper presents a novel algorithm for bounding the reachable set of parametric nonlinear differential equations. This algorithm is based on a first-discretize-then-bound approach to enclose the reachable set via propagation of a Taylor model with ellipsoidal remainder, and it accounts for truncation errors that are inherent to the discretization. In contrast to existing algorithms that proceed in two phases-an a priori enclosure phase, followed by a tightening phase-the proposed algorithm first predicts a continuous-time enclosure and then seeks a maximal step-size for which validity of the predicted enclosure can be established. It is shown that this reversed approach leads to a natural step-size control mechanism, which no longer relies on the availability of an a priori enclosure. Also described in the paper is an open-source implementation of the algorithm in ACADO Toolkit. A simple numerical case study is presented to illustrate the performance and stability of the algorithm. © 2013 IEEE.","Houska, Boris;Villanueva, Mario Eduardo;Chachuat, Benoît",23008711800;55263744900;15759305000
10.23919/ecc.2013.6669407,16,"This paper is concerned with guaranteed parameter estimation in nonlinear dynamic systems in a context of bounded measurement error. The problem consists of finding - or approximating as closely as possible - the set of all possible parameter values such that the predicted outputs match the corresponding measurements within prescribed error bounds. An exhaustive search procedure is applied, whereby the parameter set is successively partitioned into smaller boxes and exclusion tests are performed to eliminate some of these boxes, until a prespecified threshold on the approximation level is met. Exclusion tests rely on the ability to bound the solution set of the dynamic system for a given parameter subset and the tightness of these bounds is therefore paramount. Equally important is the time required to compute the bounds, thereby defining a trade-off. It is the objective of this paper to investigate this trade-off by comparing various bounding techniques based on interval arithmetic, Taylor model arithmetic and ellipsoidal calculus. When applied to a simple case study, ellipsoidal and Taylor model approaches are found to reduce the number of iterations significantly compared to interval analysis, yet the overall computational time is only reduced for tight approximation levels due to the computational overhead. © 2013 EUCA.","Paulen, Radoslav;Villanueva, Mario;Fikar, Miroslav;Chachuat, Benoit",36499722600;55263744900;6701665414;15759305000

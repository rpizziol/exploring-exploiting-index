10.1016/j.socec.2023.102106,0,"We investigate experimentally how decisions in the Dictator Game are affected by cognitive manipulations aimed at promoting greater reliance on deliberation. Specifically, we run an online experiment where we have 6 distinct experimental conditions resulting from the combination of 2 conditions for the Dictator Game (non-bully: the dictator is initially endowed with all the money; bully: the initial endowment is equally split), and 3 conditions for the cognitive manipulations (time delay: decisions are delayed; motivated delay: decisions are delayed and a written motivation is required; control: no manipulation). We find that the equal initial endowment leads the dictator to get less, confirming in the online setting previous evidence from the lab. Further, our findings suggest that the request to write a motivation makes subjects take less for themselves with respect to the mere request to wait some time before choosing.","Bilancini, Ennio;Boncinelli, Leonardo;Guarnieri, Pietro;Spadoni, Lorenzo",24175889200;24175528900;57209821376;57204426562

One of the central strategies for managing public health throughout the pandemic has been through persuasive messaging and collective behaviour change. To help scholars better understand the social and moral psychology behind public health behaviour, we present a dataset comprising of 51,404 individuals from 69 countries. This dataset was collected for the International Collaboration on Social & Moral Psychology of COVID-19 project (ICSMP COVID-19). This social science survey invited participants around the world to complete a series of moral and psychological measures and public health attitudes about COVID-19 during an early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (between April and June 2020). The survey included seven broad categories of questions: COVID-19 beliefs and compliance behaviours; identity and social attitudes; ideology; health and well-being; moral beliefs and motivation; personality traits; and demographic variables. We report both raw and cleaned data, along with all survey materials, data visualisations, and psychometric evaluations of key variables.","Azevedo, Flavio;Pavlović, Tomislav;Rêgo, Gabriel G.;Ay, F.

10.1038/s41598-023-30301-y,0,"In pairwise interactions, where two individuals meet and play a social game with each other, assortativity in cognition means that pairs where both decision-makers use the same cognitive process are more likely to occur than what happens under random matching. In this paper, we show theoretically that assortativity in cognition may arise as a consequence of assortativity in other dimensions. Moreover, we analyze an applied model where we investigate the effects of assortativity in cognition on the emergence of cooperation and on the degree of prosociality of intuition and deliberation, which are the typical cognitive processes postulated by the dual process theory in psychology. In particular, with assortativity in cognition, deliberation is able to shape the intuitive heuristic toward cooperation, increasing the degree of prosociality of intuition, and ultimately promoting the overall cooperation. Our findings rely on agent-based simulations, but analytical results are also obtained in a special case. We conclude with examples involving different payoff matrices of the underlying social games, showing that assortativity in cognition can have non-trivial implications in terms of its societal desirability.","Bilancini, Ennio;Boncinelli, Leonardo;Vicario, Eugenio",24175889200;24175528900;57222865304

To this purpose we exploited unique data from a quasi-experiment involving about two thousand students, one thousand participating (the treatment group) and one thousand not participating (the control group) in the program. Data were collected by means of a survey that we specifically designed and implemented to record students’ self-reported behaviors. Our estimates indicate that the program has been successful: the students in the program reported an increase in efficient water usage and an increase in the frequency of discussions with their parents about water usage; moreover, positive effects were still observed after six months. Our findings suggest that game-based educational programs can be an effective instrument to promote practices supporting sustainable water use behaviors in students and their parents.","Bilancini, Ennio;Boncinelli, Leonardo;Di Paolo, Roberto",24175889200;24175528900;57201116811

10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115438,4,"The impact of COVID-19 represents a specific challenge for voluntary transfusional systems sustained by the intrinsic motivations of blood donors. In general, health emergencies can stimulate altruistic behaviors. However, in this context, the same prosocial motivations, besides the personal health risks, could foster the adherence to social distancing rules to preserve collective health and, therefore, discourage blood donation activities. In this work, we investigate the consequences of the pandemic shock on the dynamics of new donors exploiting the individual-level longitudinal information contained in administrative data on the Italian region of Tuscany. We compare the change in new donors' recruitment and retention during 2020 with respect to the 2017–2019 period (we observe 9511 individuals), considering donors’ and their municipalities of residence characteristics. Our results show an increment of new donors, with higher proportional growth for older donors. Moreover, we demonstrate that the quality of new donors, as proxied by the frequency of subsequent donations, increased with respect to previous years. Finally, we show that changes in extrinsic motivations, such as the possibility of obtaining a free antibody test or overcoming movement restrictions, cannot explain the documented increase in the number of new donors and in their performance. Therefore, our analyses indicate that the Tuscan voluntary blood donation system was effective in dealing with the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bilancini, Ennio;Boncinelli, Leonardo;Di Paolo, Roberto;Menicagli, Dario;Pizziol, Veronica;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Serti, Francesco",24175889200;24175528900;57201116811;57199647974;57226799439;8565770200;26022647900

10.1038/s41467-021-27668-9,182,"Changing collective behaviour and supporting non-pharmaceutical interventions is an important component in mitigating virus transmission during a pandemic. In a large international collaboration (Study 1, N = 49,968 across 67 countries), we investigated self-reported factors associated with public health behaviours (e.g., spatial distancing and stricter hygiene) and endorsed public policy interventions (e.g., closing bars and restaurants) during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic (April-May 2020). Respondents who reported identifying more strongly with their nation consistently reported greater engagement in public health behaviours and support for public health policies. Results were similar for representative and non-representative national samples. Study 2 (N = 42 countries) conceptually replicated the central finding using aggregate indices of national identity (obtained using the World Values Survey) and a measure of actual behaviour change during the pandemic (obtained from Google mobility reports). Higher levels of national identification prior to the pandemic predicted lower mobility during the early stage of the pandemic (r = −0.40). We discuss the potential implications of links between national identity, leadership, and public health for managing COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Van Bavel, Jay J.;Cichocka, Aleksandra;Capraro, Valerio;Sjåstad, Hallgeir;Nezlek, John B.;Pavlović, Tomislav;Alfano, Mark;Gelfand, Michele J.;Azevedo, Flavio;Birtel, Michèle D.;Cislak, Aleksandra;Lockwood, Patricia L.;Ross, Robert Malcolm;Abts, Koen;Agadullina, Elena;Aruta, John Jamir Benzon;Besharati, Sahba Nomvula;Bor, Alexander;Choma, Becky L.;Crabtree, Charles David;Cunningham, William A.;De, Koustav;Ejaz, Waqas;Elbaek, Christian T.;Findor, Andrej;Flichtentrei, Daniel;Franc, Renata;Gjoneska, Biljana;Gruber, June;Gualda, Estrella;Horiuchi, Yusaku;Huynh, Toan Luu Duc;Ibanez, Augustin;Imran, Mostak Ahamed;Israelashvili, Jacob;Jasko, Katarzyna;Kantorowicz, Jaroslaw;Kantorowicz-Reznichenko, Elena;Krouwel, André;Laakasuo, Michael;Lamm, Claus;Leygue, Caroline;Lin, Ming Jen;Mansoor, Mohammad Sabbir;Marie, Antoine;Mayiwar, Lewend;Mazepus, Honorata;McHugh, Cillian;Minda, John Paul;Mitkidis, Panagiotis;Olsson, Andreas;Otterbring, Tobias;Packer, Dominic J.;Perry, Anat;Petersen, Michael Bang;Puthillam, Arathy;Riaño-Moreno, Julián C.;Rothmund, Tobias;Santamaría-García, Hernando;Schmid, Petra C.;Stoyanov, Drozdstoy;Tewari, Shruti;Todosijević, Bojan;Tsakiris, Manos;Tung, Hans H.;Umbreș, Radu G.;Vanags, Edmunds;Vlasceanu, Madalina;Vonasch, Andrew;Yucel, Meltem;Zhang, Yucheng;Abad, Mohcine;Adler, Eli;Akrawi, Narin;Mdarhri, Hamza Alaoui;Amara, Hanane;Amodio, David M.;Antazo, Benedict G.;Apps, Matthew;Ay, F.

In study 1 we run an experiment to see whether the disposition to donate (altruistic/prosocial disposition according to the Social Value Orientation scale (SVO), Murphy et al., 2011) and the disposition to reciprocate (disposition to be a conditional cooperator measured with the strategy method (dCC), Fischbacher et al., 2012) explain contribution in the PGG. In study 2 we run a similar experiment where we add the manipulation of cognition by means of two treatments: time pressure (to induce less deliberative decisions) and motivated delay (to induce more deliberative decisions). Overall, we find that: (i) a higher SVO score goes with higher contributions; (ii) higher beliefs go with higher contributions; (iii) dCC does not appreciably account for contributions; (iv) conditional contributions elicited with the strategy method predict actual contribution for the stated belief; (v) while (i)–(iv) are unaffected by treatments, contributions under motivated delay are about 10% higher than under time pressure. Our experimental evidence suggests that altruism, beliefs and predicted contributions account for contributions regardless of the extent of deliberation, which however seems to impact positively and independently contributions.","Bilancini, Ennio;Boncinelli, Leonardo;Celadin, Tatiana",24175889200;24175528900;57216634436

Greene et al. (2009) showed that psychological and situational factors (for example, the intent of the agent or the presence of physical contact between the agent and the victim) can play an important role in moral dilemma judgements (for example, the trolley problem). Our knowledge is limited concerning both the universality of these effects outside the United States and the impact of culture on the situational and psychological factors affecting moral judgements. Thus, we empirically tested the universality of the effects of intent and personal force on moral dilemma judgements by replicating the experiments of Greene et al. in 45 countries from all inhabited continents. We found that personal force and its interaction with intention exert influence on moral judgements in the US and Western cultural clusters, replicating and expanding the original findings. Moreover, the personal force effect was present in all cultural clusters, suggesting it is culturally universal. The evidence for the cultural universality of the interaction effect was inconclusive in the Eastern and Southern cultural clusters (depending on exclusion criteria). We found no strong association between collectivism/individualism and moral dilemma judgements.","Bago, Bence;Kovacs, Marton;Protzko, John;Nagy, Tamas;Kekecs, Zoltan;Palfi, Bence;Adamkovic, Matus;Adamus, Sylwia;Albalooshi, Sumaya;Albayrak-Aydemir, Nihan;Alfian, Ilham N.;Alper, Sinan;Alvarez-Solas, Sara;Alves, Sara G.;Amaya, Santiago;Andresen, Pia K.;Anjum, Gulnaz;Ansari, Daniel;Arriaga, Patrícia;Aruta, John Jamir Benzon R.;Arvanitis, Alexios;Babincak, Peter;Barzykowski, Krystian;Bashour, Bana;Baskin, Ernest;Batalha, Luisa;Batres, Carlota;Bavolar, Jozef;Bayrak, Fatih;Becker, Benjamin;Becker, Maja;Belaus, Anabel;Białek, Michał;Bilancini, Ennio;Boller, Daniel;Boncinelli, Leonardo;Boudesseul, Jordane;Brown, Benjamin T.;Buchanan, Erin M.;Butt, Muhammad M.;Calvillo, Dustin P.;Carnes, Nate C.;Celniker, Jared B.;Chartier, Christopher R.;Chopik, William J.;Chotikavan, Poom;Chuan-Peng, Hu;Clancy, Rockwell F.;Çoker, Ogeday;Correia, Rita C.;Adoric, Vera Cubela;Cubillas, Carmelo P.;Czoschke, Stefan;Daryani, Yalda;de Grefte, Job A.M.;de Vries, Wieteke C.;Burak, Elif G.Demirag;Dias, Carina;Dixson, Barnaby J.W.;Du, Xinkai;Dumančić, Francesca;Dumbravă, Andrei;Dutra, Natalia B.;Enachescu, Janina;Esteban-Serna, Celia;Eudave, Luis;Evans, Thomas R.;Feldman, Gilad;Felisberti, Fatima M.;Fiedler, Susann;Findor, Andrej;Fleischmann, Alexandra;Foroni, Francesco;Francová, Radka;Frank, Darius Aurel;Fu, Cynthia H.Y.;Gao, Shan;Ghasemi, Omid;Ghazi-Noori, Ali Reza;Ghossainy, Maliki E.;Giammusso, Isabella;Gill, Tripat;Gjoneska, Biljana;Gollwitzer, Mario;Graton, Aurélien;Grinberg, Maurice;Groyecka-Bernard, Agata;Harris, Elizabeth A.;Hartanto, Andree;Hassan, Widad A.N.M.;Hatami, Javad;Heimark, Katrina R.;Hidding, Jasper J.J.;Hristova, Evgeniya;Hruška, Matej;Hudson, Charlotte A.;Huskey, Richard;Ikeda, Ayumi;Inbar, Yoel;Ingram, Gordon P.D.",55314391300;57221101702;36081278800;56625624500;36739136000;56826059800;57196025569;57226523558;57209450218;57219304546;57203788506;56673764500;57200230204;57226528344;54879957300;57573591700;57194337944;23033422400;12793958200;57205719637;55131332000;6504015735;54973721600;55631985400;56175351400;22978255800;56260867000;57226510288;57211604087;35745466700;36522239600;57188645239;56333322000;24175889200;57203650796;24175528900;56433471800;56810118200;36624932600;56088395600;8453501100;55250501900;57202339692;37025683600;39260935300;57572823700;56398739000;57021047400;57573972900;57226534335;8372540600;55821313500;57194646490;57573783600;57193276665;57573591800;57222749491;57203432829;13907430600;57226539055;57214318712;57194817340;57192267108;57202990264;57216892180;57189999067;57203927621;56357914500;6603208865;54881099700;15051465700;56637959000;30767558200;57573214400;57210979064;8502155300;55235463800;57220761172;57573214600;55843536100;57203282754;7201760215;57211203812;57206445185;56899025000;25942981500;57223085437;57215611020;56912243000;57573973100;56013524900;57224092764;57260633200;8886506700;57196236805;57204626980;56394345300;57208550955;26867844000;55139333100

,0,"Escape from the Castle is a digital escape game created with the collaboration of the Museum of Saving in Turin (Italy), Neuroscience Lab Intesa Sanpaolo Innovation Center, and the GAME Science Research Center of IMT School for Ad-vanced Studies Lucca. In the escape game, players must help Mica, the mascot of the Museum, to run away from the Ghost of the Baroness, from its Castle. To do that, every player has to solve four puzzles in four different rooms. Each room is correlated to a financial issue, such as saving strategies and planning. The game aims to increase the awareness that money represents a means for achieving a purpose (i.e., use value of money) and not an end, from a behavioural and neuroscientific point of view. So we built a study about the behaviour of teenagers. According to the literature, the cooperative approach proposes emotional and cognitive involvement as a tool to strengthen learning, increases awareness of self-efficacy and, when applied to money management, increases the self-perception of being able to make consumption choices. To better understand the mechanisms of cooperation, we built an experiment with 118 students from eleven to fourteen years old, that played the game during a visit to the Museum. We divided students into two groups: one in which students could collaborate with each other in solving the puzzles (treatment) and one in which they had to play individually (control), and we collected score and time of play (behavioural data). In each group, two students wore eye-trackers to record pupil dilation to collect neurophysiological data. Here we present mainly the behavioural results that show that the students who were allowed to collaborate obtained, on average, double the score compared to those who played individually. Furthermore, those who collaborated finished the game in less time than those who have not played as a group. Moreover, combining behavioural data with neurophysiological data, there are indications that high pupil dilation is correlated with high engage-ment in play, and this is often true in collaborating groups.","Bisanti, Matteo;Di Paolo, Roberto;Pizziol, Veronica;Accardi, Sebastiano;Maggi, Francesca;Paladino, Giovanna;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Bilancini, Ennio",26026262000;57201116811;57226799439;57951273700;57232266500;6603147464;8565770200;24175889200

We provide a condition on the underlying game, named supremacy, and show that the population state in which all agents play the supreme strategy is globally asymptotically stable. We extend the framework to allow for payoff uncertainty, and check the robustness of our results to the introduction of some heterogeneity in the revision protocol followed by agents. Finally, we show that PIID can allow the survival of strictly dominated strategies, leads to the emergence of inefficient conventions in social dilemmas, and makes assortment ineffective in promoting cooperation.","Bilancini, Ennio;Boncinelli, Leonardo;Campigotto, Nicola",24175889200;24175528900;57215609757

Labeling is modeled as the (verifiable) public disclosure of an otherwise unobservable trait of the seller that is correlated with the quality of the product. Our main finding is that market unraveling can fail, in which case imposing mandatory disclosure can backfire. When the joint distribution of seller's qualities and traits is exogenous, if market unraveling fails and mandatory labeling is imposed, then profits decrease for high-quality sellers and, if the label is sufficiently informative, buyers are better off and profits increase for low-quality sellers as well. When, instead, the joint distribution of qualities and traits is endogenous, mandatory labeling fails to yield an increase in average quality and buyers' utility, while cost inefficiencies arise.","Bilancini, Ennio;Boncinelli, Leonardo",24175889200;24175528900

Amongst the reasons for why policy-makers rely on social norms intervention tools is that the relevant underlying theory, which is concerned with dynamic-stochastic deviations processes, has matured substantially over the past three decades. In this article, turning to behavioral evidence, we investigate which of the models proposed in this strand of theory are supported regarding individual human behavior. Specifically, we identify which assumptions regarding individual-level adjustment behavior in terms of optimal play (‘best response’) and deviations thereof (‘noise’) are supported. In doing so, we move the focus of research from the theoretical and modeling question ‘How Noise Matters?’ (Blume, 2003) to the behavioral and empirical question ‘What Noise Matters?’.","Bilancini, Ennio;Boncinelli, Leonardo;Nax, Heinrich H.",24175889200;24175528900;23501902800

We find that the harshness of social competition is maximal for an intermediate level of inequality, and that increasing or decreasing inequality beyond that level monotonically mitigates social competition, up to completely eliminating it at the extremes. If social competition is wasteful, utilitarian welfare is maximized in case of equality. A greater uncertainty about the connection between today's rewards and tomorrow's endowments mitigates social competition. Finally, there emerge concerns for others’ resources that are downward and not upward, with the value of high social standing which changes non-monotonically in the resources of those with lower standing.","Bilancini, Ennio;Boncinelli, Leonardo",24175889200;24175528900

To fully explore the implications of this error model, we introduce a further novelty in the way we model the interaction structure, assuming that with positive probability agents remain matched together in the next period. We find that, if interactions are sufficiently persistent over time, then the payoff-dominant convention emerges in the long run, while if interactions are quite volatile, then the maximin convention can emerge even if it is not risk-dominant.

10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02750,5,"Strategic interactions have been studied extensively in the area of judgment and decision-making. However, so far no specific measure of a decision-maker's ability to be successful in strategic interactions has been proposed and tested. Our contribution is the development of a measure of strategic ability that borrows from both game theory and psychology. Such measure is aimed at providing an estimation of the likelihood of success in many social activities that involve strategic interaction among multiple decision-makers. To construct a reliable measure of strategic ability, that we propose to call ""Strategic Quotient"" (SQ), we designed a test where each item is a game and where, therefore, the individual obtained score depends on the distribution of choices of other decision-makers taking the test. The test is designed to provide information on the abilities related to two dimensions, mentalization and rationality, that we argue are crucial to strategic success, with each dimension being characterized by two main factors. Principal component analysis on preliminary data shows that indeed four factors (two for rationality, two for mentalization) account for strategic success in most of the strategically simpler games of the test. Moreover, two more strategically sophisticated games are inserted in the test and are used to investigate if and to what extent the four factors obtained by simpler games can predict strategic success in more sophisticated strategic interactions. Overall, the collected empirical evidence points to the possibility of building a SQ measure using only simple games designed to capture information about the four identified factors.","Bilancini, Ennio;Boncinelli, Leonardo;Mattiassi, Alan",24175889200;24175528900;56300872300

They consider the joint role of pre-tax wage inequality and of social norms determining how social status is assigned. They find that when social status is ordinal (i.e., only one's rank in the income distribution matters) inequality and taxation are substitutes. Instead, when status is cardinal (i.e., also the shape of the income distribution matters) inequality and taxation can be complements, although the relationship is in general non-monotonic. This is because the value of social status is endogenous, potentially giving rise to a perverse self-reinforcing mechanism where more waste in conspicuous consumption induces a greater competition for status and vice versa.","Bilancini, Ennio;Boncinelli, Leonardo",24175889200;24175528900

We show that when the cost of interacting with a different type is small with respect to the payoff of coordination, the payoff-dominant convention is the only stochastically stable convention; instead, when the cost of interacting with a different type is large, the only stochastically stable conventions are those where all agents of one type play the payoff-dominant action and all agents of the other type play the risk-dominant action.","Bilancini, Ennio;Boncinelli, Leonardo",24175889200;24175528900

The decision-maker receives a message containing an offer of unknown quality together with a reference cue that associates the offer with a category of offers, whose average quality is known. The decision-maker initially exerts little cognitive effort in processing the message, assessing the offer quality on the sole basis of the reference cue (acting as a “coarse thinker”). The decision-maker can then take a decision on the offer without further investigating or she can exert substantial cognitive effort to scrutinize the message carefully and obtain more precise knowledge of the offer quality. The proposed model predicts that the persuader can exploit reference cues to affect attitudes both directly (by inducing acceptance of offers) and indirectly (by inducing low cognitive effort, and hence influencing acceptance). This model matches several predictions of prominent psychological models of attitude change such as the Elaboration Likelihood Model and the Heuristic-Systematic Model.","Bilancini, Ennio;Boncinelli, Leonardo",24175889200;24175528900
10.1016/j.euroecorev.2017.12.001,16,"This paper investigates the emergence of cooperation in a heterogeneous population that is divided into two cultural groups. Agents are randomly matched in pairs to engage in a prisoner dilemma. The matching process is assortative in actions, that is, cooperators are more likely to be matched with cooperators, defectors are more likely to be matched with defectors. Agents exhibit a form of cultural intolerance: when two agents of different cultures are matched, they suffer a cost due to their cultural differences. We find that when cultural intolerance is sufficiently strong, homophily emerges together with perfect correlation between culture and behavior: all agents from one cultural group cooperate, while all agents from the other cultural group defect, and interactions among agents within the same cultural group are more frequent. The relation between cultural intolerance and societal welfare is non-monotonic. In particular, stronger cultural intolerance can increase cooperation when action-assortativity is weak, while it can increase defection when action-assortativity is strong. Moreover, everyone cooperating does not necessarily maximize total welfare unless cultural intolerance can be made sufficiently weak.","Bilancini, Ennio;Boncinelli, Leonardo;Wu, Jiabin",24175889200;24175528900;57190809982

We obtain that full trade occurs in every dynamic competitive equilibrium. Moreover, we show that if prices can be conditioned on the supply size then a dynamic competitive equilibrium always exists, while it fails to exist if prices cannot be conditioned on the supply size and the frequency of exchanges is high enough. We conclude that the possibility to condition prices on the supply size allows us to reach efficiency in the limit for exchanges becoming more and more frequent, while otherwise the welfare loss due to delays of exchanges remains bounded away from zero.","Bilancini, Ennio;Boncinelli, Leonardo",24175889200;24175528900

In particular, we consider the shape of reduced preferences that emerge in the equilibrium of a two-sided matching model with non-transferable utility. Cole et al. (1992, 1995) show that, under full observability of potential mates[U+05F3] attributes, instrumental concerns for social status are ordinal, i.e., only one[U+05F3]s own rank in the distribution of attributes matters. We show that when we depart from full observability, instrumental concerns for social status become cardinal, i.e., also other features of the distribution of attributes matter. We also show that the actual shape of cardinal concerns depends on how individuals can deal with the informational asymmetry, alternatively leading to upward concerns, i.e., making comparisons with higher rank people; downward concerns, i.e., making comparisons with lower rank people; or bidirectional concerns, i.e, being both upward and downward. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Bilancini, Ennio;Boncinelli, Leonardo",24175889200;24175528900

Our results suggest that the variation of Germans' well-being between 1996 and 2007 is well predicted by changes over time of income, demographics and social capital. The increase in social capital predicts the largest positive change in subjective well-being. Income growth, also predicts a substantial change in subjective well-being, but it is compensated for about three fourths by the joint negative predictions due to income comparison and income adaptation. Finally, we find that aging of the population predicts the largest negative change in subjective well-being.

Skills can be either revealed or kept hidden, but while agents on one side have verifiable skills, agents on the other side have skills that are unverifiable unless certified, and certification is costly. Agents who have revealed their skill enter a standard matching market, while others are matched randomly. We find that in equilibrium only agents with skills above a cutoff reveal, and then they match assortatively. We show that an equilibrium always exists, and we discuss multiplicity. Increasing differences play an important role to shape equilibria, and we remark that this is unusual in matching models with non-transferable utility.

10.1007/s11205-011-9971-x,116,"During the last 30 years US citizens experienced, on average, a decline in reported happiness, social connections, and confidence in institutions. We show that a remarkable portion of the decrease in happiness is predicted by the decline in social connections and confidence in institutions. We carry out our investigation in three steps. First, we run a happiness regression that includes various indicators of social connections and confidence in institutions, alongside with own income, reference income, and the usual socio-demographic controls. We find that indicators of social connections and confidence in institutions are positively and significantly correlated with happiness. Second, we investigate the evolution of social connections and confidence in institutions over time, finding that they generally show a declining trend. Third, we calculate the variation in happiness over time as predicted by each of its statistically significant correlates, finding that the decrease in happiness is mainly predicted by the decline in social connections and by the growth in reference income. More precisely, the sum of the negative changes in happiness predicted by the reduction in social connections and the increase in reference income more than offsets the positive change predicted by the growth of household income. Also, the reduction in happiness predicted by the decline in confidence in institutions is non-negligible, although substantially smaller than the one predicted by either social connections or reference income. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Bartolini, Stefano;Bilancini, Ennio;Pugno, Maurizio",57193482010;24175889200;56042579400

We analyze three regimes: a decentralized economy where each household makes isolated choices without considering their external effects, a planned economy where a myopic planner fails to recognize both leisure and consumption externalities but recognizes production externalities, and a planned economy with a fully informed planner. We first compare the balanced growth paths under the three regimes and then we numerically investigate the transition to the optimal balanced growth path. We provide a number of findings. First, in a decentralized economy growth or labor (or both) are greater than in the regime with a fully informed planner, and hence are sub-optimal from a welfare standpoint. Second, a myopic intervention which overlooks consumption and leisure externalities leads to more growth and labor than in both the decentralized and the fully informed regime. Third, we provide a case for happy degrowth: a transition to the optimal balanced growth path that is associated with downscaling of production, a reduction in private consumption, and an ongoing increase in leisure and well-being. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Bilancini, Ennio;D'Alessandro, Simone",24175889200;57235051600

10.1016/j.jpubeco.2012.05.007,22,"We study the impact of redistributive policies when agents can signal their social status by spending on a conspicuous good. Our focus is on how the shape of the status function - i.e., how social status is computed and evaluated - can affect the equilibrium outcome of the model, and in particular the relationship between inequality and wasteful conspicuous consumption. We find that if status depends in an ordinal way on individuals' relative standing in terms of economic resources, then redistributing resources from the rich to the poor increases social waste because it forces the rich to spend more on conspicuous consumption in order to differentiate themselves from the poor. If, instead, status depends in a cardinal way on individuals' relative standing, then a redistribution of resources in favor of the poor can reduce social waste. This is possible because under cardinal status there is an additional effect: a lesser degree of inequality decreases the value of social status and, hence, reduces the incentives to engage in wasteful social competition. If this second effect is stronger than the first one, then social waste reduces. In this case a Pareto improvement is also possible but it requires, in addition, that the rich save enough on costly signaling to compensate for the losses due to the reduction of economic resources. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Bilancini, Ennio;Boncinelli, Leonardo",24175889200;24175528900

We show how differences in agricultural institutions may have produced different development paths in two countries which were similar under many respects. While in New Zealand the active role of the Crown in regulating the land market facilitated access to land, in Uruguay land was seized by a small group of large landowners. Our model shows that land concentration may have negatively influenced industrialization and growth by impeding the formation of a large group of middle-income landowners and, as a consequence, the development of a domestic demand for basic manufactures.

Our finding has two important theoretical consequences. First, assuming that preferences depend on budget sets is illegitimate under the scientific commitments of revealed preference theory. Second, as long as consumers' preferences are not defined over budget sets, we can assume that preferences depend on observable objects other than own consumption without compromising the logical possibility to reject the model against observation. We however point out that, despite this logical possibility, in practice it can be almost impossible to reject a model where preferences are defined over objects that depend on budget sets. As an example of this we show that if preferences are defined over consumption choices of other individuals then rationalization fails only in cases of negligible practical interest. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Bilancini, Ennio",24175889200

In other words, GDP growth does not predict the long run growth of subjective well-being.

More precisely, we illustrate the role of sociability as a predictor of well-being, presenting the available evidence at both the within-country and the worldwide level.

In spite of a long tradition dealing with the matter from different perspectives, the emergence of cooperation or defection still remains a controversial issue from both an empirical and a theoretical point of view. In this paper we propose a local interaction model with endogenous network formation, in the attempt to provide a reasonable account of emerging behaviors. A population of boundedly rational agents repeatedly chooses to cooperate or defect. Each agent's action affects only her interacting mates, according to a network of relationships. Agents are randomly given the possibility to substitute undesired mates with unknown ones. Full cooperation, full defection and coexistence of both cooperation and defection in homogeneous clusters are possible outcomes of the model.

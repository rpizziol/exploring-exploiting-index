10.1109/TITS.2023.3254442,2,"Technological advances in the telecommunications industry have brought significant advantages in the management and performance of communication networks. The railway industry is among the ones that have benefited the most. These interconnected systems, however, have a wide area exposed to cyberattacks. This survey examines the cybersecurity aspects of railway systems by considering the standards, guidelines, frameworks, and technologies used in the industry to assess and mitigate cybersecurity risks, particularly regarding the relationship between safety and security. To do so, we dedicate specific attention to signaling, which fundamental reliance on computer and communication technologies allows us to explore better the multifaceted nature of the security of modern hyperconnected railway systems. With this in mind, we then move on to analyzing the approaches and tools that practitioners can use to facilitate the cyber security process. In detail, we present a view on cyber ranges as an enabling technology to model and emulate computer networks and attack-defense scenarios, study vulnerabilities' impact, and finally devise countermeasures. We also discuss several possible use cases strongly connected to the railway industry reality.","Soderi, Simone;Masti, Daniele;Lun, Yuriy Zacchia",56027760800;57195274877;58081161100
10.1016/j.cose.2023.103133,0,"Physical layer security mechanisms use primitives that exploit physical properties of the communication channel to protect data. Protecting communications at the physical layer offers some advantages, e.g., in terms of reduced computations, since complex cryptographic procedures are not executed, However, these mechanisms lack a formal specification that prevent protocols and applications that use them from being verified and compared with those based on cyptography. Here we start filling this gap by providing an axiomatization of key physical layer security primitives and proposing a variant of the Dolev–Yao attacker model that takes them into account. We show that our formalization enables applying existing automatic tools for verifying security of protocols. Then, we show that these primitives are a valuable alternative and effective complement to cryptography, because they ensure confidentiality and integrity but require a lower energy consumption and often they also reduce transmission time. Finally, we characterize the specific application domains and network features that make adopting these security mechanisms particularly profitable with respect to the AES cypher.","Costa, Gabriele;Degano, Pierpaolo;Galletta, Letterio;Soderi, Simone",32067717500;7006345611;55260418300;56027760800
10.1109/TDSC.2022.3179562,1,"The Control Area Network (CAN) represents the standard bus for intra-vehicular networks communication. Unfortunately, CAN was not designed to be a secure protocol. Communications over CAN do not take advantage of any security feature (e.g., cryptography and authentication), raising different vulnerabilities in critical applications. This lack of security is even more emphasized in recent CAN networks, which integrate remote connection capabilities (e.g., Bluetooth and WiFi). This insecurity-by-design led to the development of specific mechanisms to patch CAN vulnerabilities. Many proposed solutions rely on implementing optimized cryptographic primitives and assume that the cryptographic keys were previously shared among the different nodes during the production phase, omitting the issue related to keys distribution and update. We propose SENECAN, a solution that combines watermarking and wired jamming to secure the CAN bus's long-term key distribution. Our solution leverages intentional interference and spread spectrum watermarking to achieve security properties such as confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and anti-replay. Compared to other works, SENECAN does not require any CAN protocol and system architecture modification. Instead, it requires an additional CAN transceiver and an initial transmission overhead. Finally, we tested the effectiveness and functioning of the SENECAN distribution schema in a real CAN environment.","Soderi, Simone;Colelli, Riccardo;Turrin, Federico;Pascucci, Federica;Conti, Mauro",56027760800;57204806382;57210978211;57202617407;15019127200
10.1007/978-3-031-47359-3_22,0,"Internet of Everything (IoE) is a newly emerging trend, especially in homes. Marketing forces toward smart homes are also accelerating the spread of IoE devices in households. An obvious risk of the rapid adoption of these smart devices is that many lack controls for protecting the privacy and security of end users from attacks designed to disrupt lives and incur financial losses. Today the smart home is a system for managing the basic life support processes of both small systems, e.g., commercial, office premises, apartments, cottages, and largely automated complexes, e.g., commercial and industrial complexes. One of the critical tasks to be solved by the concept of a modern smart home is the problem of preventing the usage of IoE resources. Recently, there has been a rapid increase in attacks on consumer IoE devices. Memory corruption vulnerabilities constitute a significant class of vulnerabilities in software security through which attackers can gain control of an entire system. Numerous memory corruption vulnerabilities have been found in IoE firmware already deployed in the consumer market. This paper aims to analyze and explain the resource usage attack and create a low-cost simulation environment to aid in the dynamic analysis of the attack. Further, we perform controlled resource usage attacks while measuring resource consumption on resource-constrained victims’ IoE devices, such as CPU and memory utilization. We also build a lightweight algorithm to detect memory usage attacks in the IoE environment. The result shows high efficiency in detecting and mitigating memory usage attacks by detecting when the intruder starts and stops the attack.","Alwaisi, Zainab;Soderi, Simone;De Nicola, Rocco",58656247000;56027760800;7004298169

The rapid growth of IoT technology has revolutionized human life by inaugurating the concept of smart healthcare, smart devices, smart city, and smart grid. The security of IoT devices has become a serious concern, especially in the healthcare domain, where recent attacks exposed damaging IoT security vulnerabilities. In addition, in IoT networks where the connected devices are vulnerable to attacks such as attacks that affect the resource constraints of healthcare devices, e.g., energy consumption attacks. Therefore, this paper defines the impact of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and Fake Access Points (F-APs) attacks on WiFi smart healthcare devices and investigates in detail how these attacks can be deployed toward victim devices and Access Points (APs). Our work focuses on IoT devices’ connectivity and energy consumption when under attack. The main key findings of this paper are as follows: (i) the minimum and maximum attack rate of DDoS attacks that cause service disruptions on the victim side, and (ii) the minimum-the higher effect of energy-consumption Distributed Denial of Service (EC-DDoS) and F-APs attacks on the energy consumption of the smart healthcare devices. Our study reveals the communication protocols, attack rates, payload sizes, and victim devices’ ports state as the vital factors in determining the energy consumption of victim devices. These findings facilitate a thorough understanding of IoT devices’ potential vulnerabilities within a smart healthcare environment and pave solid foundations for future studies on defense solutions.","Alwaisi, Zainab;Soderi, Simone;Nicola, Rocco De",58656247000;56027760800;58655938600
10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3309005,0,"The CENELEC TS 50701 is the first encompassing standard aiming at governing cybersecurity risk management processes within the railway industry. Although the technical maturity of this framework is undeniable, its application in practical projects is still an active field of discussion among practitioners, especially when dealing the communication-heavy subsystems. Among such subsystems, signalling is among the most critical ones. Both Communication-based Train Control (CBTC) and European Railway Traffic Management Systems (ERTMS) heavily rely on wireless communications for their operation. This paper describes two cybersecurity attack scenarios regarding wireless communications for CBTCs that can impact the safety of these systems using the lens of the framework provided by the novel CENELEC TS 50701. In doing so, we discuss the implications of using such guidance, especially concerning the different interpretations found in the literature regarding zoning communication systems, to assess and mitigate the cybersecurity risk and improve the posture of CBTC systems concerning the examined attacks.

10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3229124,1,"Federated learning (FL) goes beyond traditional, centralized machine learning by distributing model training among a large collection of edge clients. These clients cooperatively train a global, e.g., cloud-hosted, model without disclosing their local, private training data. The global model is then shared among all the participants which use it for local predictions. This paper proves that FL systems can be turned into covert channels to implement a stealth communication infrastructure. The main intuition is that, during federated training, a malicious sender can poison the global model by submitting purposely crafted examples. Although the effect of the model poisoning is negligible to other participants and does not alter the overall model performance, it can be observed by a malicious receiver and used to transmit a sequence of bits. We mounted our attack on an FL system to verify its feasibility. Experimental evidence shows that this covert channel is reliable, efficient, and extremely hard to counter. These results highlight that our new attacker model threatens FL infrastructures.","Costa, Gabriele;Pinelli, Fabio;Soderi, Simone;Tolomei, Gabriele",32067717500;57223750427;56027760800;12784026600
10.1109/SECON55815.2022.9918547,3,"Visible Light Communication (VLC) is one the most promising enabling technology for future 6G networks to over-come Radio-Frequency (RF)-based communication limitations thanks to a broader bandwidth, higher data rate, and greater efficiency. However, from the security perspective, VLCs suffer from all known wireless communication security threats (e.g., eavesdropping and integrity attacks). For this reason, security re-searchers are proposing innovative Physical Layer Security (PLS) solutions to protect such communication. Among the different solutions, the novel Reflective Intelligent Surface (RIS) technology coupled with VLCs has been successfully demonstrated in recent work to improve the VLC communication capacity. However, to date, the literature still lacks analysis and solutions to show the PLS capability of RIS-based VLC communication. In this paper, we combine watermarking and jamming prim-itives through the Watermark Blind Physical Layer Security (WBPLSec) algorithm to secure VLC communication at the physical layer. Our solution leverages RIS technology to improve the security properties of the communication. By using an opti-mization framework, we can calculate RIS phases to maximize the WBPLSec jamming interference schema over a predefined area in the room. In particular, compared to a scenario without RIS, our solution improves the performance in terms of secrecy capacity without any assumption about the adversary's location. We validate through numerical evaluations the positive impact of RIS-aided solution to increase the secrecy capacity of the legitimate jamming receiver in a VLC indoor scenario. Our results show that the introduction of RIS technology extends the area where secure communication occurs and that by increasing the number of RIS elements the outage probability decreases.","Soderi, Simone;Brighente, Alessandro;Turrin, Federico;Conti, Mauro",56027760800;57193847211;57210978211;15019127200
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3139456,15,"Visible Light Communication (VLC) is a key technology for the sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication thanks to the possibility of using artificial environmental lights as a data transfer channel. Although VLC systems are more resistant against interference and less susceptible to security vulnerabilities like most wireless networks, VLC is even inherently susceptible to eavesdropping attacks. Moreover, since VLC is considered an enabling technology for 6G, specific mechanisms are needed to enforce data security. This paper considers improving the security of the next generation of wireless communications by using the Watermark Blind Physical Layer Security (WBPLSec) in VLCs. The main intuition is that RGB LEDs offer the possibility for Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) as a useful support for the Spread-Spectrum (SS) watermarking. In this paper, we propose an approach that aims at obtaining VLC Physical Layer Security (PLS) by combining watermarking with an RGB LED jamming. We provide a performance analysis of the proposed security architecture based on the secrecy capacity in terms of its existence and outage probability. We prove that WBPLSec can be used to significantly improve confidentiality in the next generation of wireless communications.

These improvements enabled the deployment of new and smart products. Today, wireless body area networks (WBAN) are commonly used to collect humans’ information, hence this evolution exposes wireless systems to new security threats. Recently, the interest by cyber-criminals in this information has increased. Many of these wireless devices are equipped with passive speakers and microphones that may be used to exchange data with each other. This paper describes the application of the watermark-based blind physical layer security (WBPLSec) to acoustic communications as unconventional wireless link. Since wireless sensors have a limited computation power the WBPLSec is a valuable physical layer standalone solution to save energy. Actually, this protocol does not need any additional radio frequency (RF) connection. Indeed, it combines watermarking and a jamming techniques over sound-waves to create secure region around the legitimate receiver. Due to their nature, wireless communications might experience eavesdropping attacks. The analysis proposed in this paper, addresses countermeasures against confidentiality attacks on short-range wireless communications. The experiments over the acoustic air-gap channel showed that WBPLSec can create a region two meters wide in which wireless nodes are able to communicate securely. Therefore, the results favor the use of this scheme as a key enabling technology to protect the confidentiality in wireless sensor networks.","Soderi, S.",56027760800

10.1007/s10723-012-9228-1,7,"Computational Grid is a well-established platform that gives an assurance to provide a vast range of heterogeneous resources for high performance computing. Efficient and effective resource management and Grid job scheduling are key requirements in order to optimize the use of the resources and to take full advantage from Grid systems. In this paper, we study the job scheduling problem in Computational Grid by using a game-theoretic approach. Grid resources are usually owned by different organizations which may have different and possibly conflicting concerns. Thus it is a crucial objective to analyze potential scenarios where selfish or cooperative behaviors of organizations impact heavily on global Grid efficiency. To this purpose, we formulate a repeated non-cooperative job scheduling game, whose players are Grid sites and whose strategies are scheduling algorithms. We exploit the concept of Nash equilibrium to express a situation in which no player can gain any profit by unilaterally changing its strategy. We extend and complement our previous work by showing whether, under certain circumstances, each investigated strategy is a Nash equilibrium or not. In the negative case we give a counter-example, in the positive case we either give a formal proof or motivate our conjecture by experimental results supported by simulations and exhaustive search. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Buscemi, Maria Grazia;Montanari, Ugo;Taneja, Sonia",57192147150;7004968272;58341886900

Despite their widespread adoption as a theoretical tool, though, they still face some unresolved semantic issues, since the standard operational, denotational and logical methods often proved inadequate to reason about these formalisms. A domain which has been successfully employed for languages with asymmetric communication, like the π-calculus, are presheaf categories based on (injective) rela-bellings, such as Set I. Calculi with symmetric binding, in the spirit of the fusion calculus, give rise to novel research challenges.

The participants negotiate their behaviours, and if an agreement is reached they commit and start an execution which is guaranteed to respect the interaction scheme agreed upon. These ideas are materialised through a calculus of contracts enriched with semiring-based constraints, which allow clients to choose services and to interact with them in a safe way. A concrete representation of these constraints with logic programs is straightforward, thus reducing constraint solution (and consequently the establishment of a contract) to the execution of a logic program. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Buscemi, Maria Grazia;Coppo, Mario;Dezani-Ciancaglini, Mariangiola;Montanari, Ugo",57192147150;7004562532;6603901213;7004968272

Our language combines a synchronous channel-based communication mechanism with a set of primitives for constraint handling. We also illustrated a variant of the calculus in which the standard non-deterministic choice is replaced by a prioritised guarded choice that follows a static form of priority favouring its left over its right argument. We show how both versions of the calculus work by considering two case studies of the Sensoria Project taken from the Telecommunication and Finance domains. Specifically, we apply the original cc-pi calculus for specifying Telco QoS policies and for enforcing them at execution time, and we formalise in the prioritised cc-pi a QoS-aware negotiation of a credit request service. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Buscemi, Maria Grazia;Montanari, Ugo",57192147150;7004968272
10.1016/j.jlap.2010.04.001,13,"Service composition in Service Oriented Computing concerns not only integration of heterogeneous distributed applications but also dynamic selection of services. Quality of Service (QoS) plays a key role in service composition as services providing the same functionalities can be differentiated according to their QoS guarantees. At subscription time, a service requester and a provider may sign a contract recording the QoS of the supplied service. The cc-pi calculus has been introduced as a constraint-based model of QoS contracts. In this work we propose a variant of the cc-pi calculus in which the alternatives in a choice rather than being selected non-deterministically have a dynamic priority. Basically, a guard cj:πj in a choice is enabled if the constraint cj is entailed by the store of constraints and the prefix πj can be consumed. Moreover, the j-th branch can be selected not only if the corresponding guard cj:πj is enabled but also if cj is weaker than the constraints ci of the other enabled alternatives. We prove that our choice operator is more general than a choice operator with static priority. Finally, we exploit some examples to show that our prioritised calculus allows arbitrarily complex QoS negotiations and that a static form of priority is strictly less expressive than ours. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

10.1145/1774088.1774598,20,"Service composition concerns both integration of heterogeneous distributed applications and dynamic selection of services. QoS-aware selection enables a service requester with certain QoS requirements to classify services according to their QoS guarantees. In this paper we present a method that allows for a fuzzy-valued description of QoS parameters. Fuzzy sets are suited to specify both the QoS preferences raised by a service requester such as 'response time must be as lower as possible and cannot be more that 1000ms' and approximate estimates a provider can make on the QoS capabilities of its services like 'availability is roughly between 95% and 99%'. We propose a matchmaking procedure based on a fuzzy-valued similarity measure that, given the specifications of QoS parameters of the requester and the providers, selects the most appropriate service among several functionally-equivalent ones.

10.1007/978-3-642-00590-9_22,1,"Orchestrators are descriptions at implementation level and may contain sensitive information that should be kept private. Consequently, orchestration languages come equipped with a notion of abstract processes, which enable the interaction among parties while hiding private information. An interesting question is whether an abstract process accurately describes the behavior of a concrete process so to ensure that some particular property is preserved when composing services. In this paper we focus on compliance, i.e, the correct interaction of two orchestrators and we introduce two definitions of abstraction: one in terms of traces, called trace-based abstraction, and the other as a generalization of symbolic bisimulation, called simulation-based abstraction.We show that simulation-based abstraction is strictly more refined than trace-based abstraction and that simulation-based abstraction behaves well with respect to compliance.","Buscemi, Maria Grazia;Melgratti, Hernán",57192147150;10042207200

10.1007/978-3-540-78739-6_20,27,"The concurrent constraint pi-calculus (cc-pi-calculus) has been introduced as a model for concluding Service Level Agreements. The cc-pi calculus combines the synchronous communication paradigm of process calculi with the constraint handling mechanism of concurrent constraint programming. While in the original presentation of the calculus a reduction semantics has been proposed, in this work we investigate the abstract semantics of cc-pi processes. First, we define a labelled transition system of the calculus and a notion of open bisimilarity à la pi-calculus that is proved to be a congruence. Next, we give a symbolic characterisation of bisimulation and we prove that the two semantics coincide. Essentially, two processes are open bisimilar if they have the same stores of constraints - this can be statically checked - and if their moves can be mutually simulated. A key idea of the symbolic transition system is to have 'contextual' labels, i.e. labels specifying that a process can evolve only in presence of certain constraints. Finally, we show that the polyadic Explicit Fusions calculus introduced by Gardner and Wischik can be translated into monadic cc-pi and that such a transition preserves open bisimilarity. The mapping exploits fusions and tuple unifications as constraints. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Buscemi, Maria Grazia;Montanari, Ugo",57192147150;7004968272

Nevertheless, the approaches appeared in the literature deal with these aspects as independent features. We claim that transactional mechanisms are relevant for programming multi-step SLA negotiations and, hence, it is worth investigating the interplay among such formal approaches. In this paper we propose a process calculus, the committed cc-pi, that combines two proposals: (i) cc-pi calculus accounting for SLA negotiation and (ii) cJoin as a model of long running transactions.

10.1109/TASE.2007.18,5,"Telco services are evolving under several aspects: for instance, services may combine different telecommunication features (messaging, multi-media, etc.) and may be activated and controlled by applications deployed in a 3rd party domain. Telco infrastructures are following this trend by adopting Service Oriented Architecture solutions, e.g. for composing services and for introducing uniform interaction models among services. In a SOA-based system, capabilities, requirements and general features of services can be expressed in terms of policies. Such policies are negotiated in order to define a Service Level Agreement among the involved parties. In this paper we show how to specify, negotiate, and enforce policies for Telco services by using a constraint-based model, the cc-pi calculus. This language extends concurrent constraint programming with synchronous communication and local names, and with the notion of soft constraints, that generalise classical constraints to represent preference levels. In cc-pi calculus, policies are expressed as soft constraints and the parties involved in the negotiation as communicating processes. The model allows to specify complex scenarios in which policy negotiations and validations can be arbitrarily nested. © 2007 IEEE.","Buscemi, Maria Grazia;Ferrari, Laura;Moiso, Corrado;Montanari, Ugo",57192147150;57190083508;6701805460;7004968272

SLA contracts specify client requirements and service guarantees, with emphasis on Quality of Service (cost, performance, availability, etc.). In this work we propose a simple model of contracts for QoS and SLAs that also allows to study mechanisms for resource allocation and for joining different SLA requirements. Our language combines two basic programming paradigms: name-passing calculi and concurrent constraint programming (cc programming). Specifically, we extend cc programming by adding synchronous communication and by providing a treatment of names in terms of restriction and structural axioms closer to nominal calculi than to variables with existential quantification. In the resulting framework, SLA requirements are constraints that can be generated either by a single party or by the synchronisation of two agents. Moreover, restricting the scope of names allows for local stores of constraints, which may become global as a consequence of synchronisations. Our approach relies on a system of named constraints that equip classical constraints with a suitable algebraic structure providing a richer mechanism of constraint combination.

10.1007/11580850_5,7,"We study fusion and binding mechanisms in name passing process calculi. To this purpose, we introduce the U-Calculus, a process calculus with no I/O polarities and a unique form of binding. The latter can be used both to control the scope of fusions and to handle new name generation. This is achieved by means of a simple form of typing: each bound name x is annotated with a set of exceptions, that is names that cannot be fused to x. The new calculus is proven to be more expressive than pi-calculus and Fusion calculus separately. In U-Calculus, the syntactic nesting of name binders has a semantic meaning, which cannot be overcome by the ordering of name extrusions at; runtime. Thanks to this mixture of static and dynamic ordering of names, U-Calculus admits a form of labelled bisimulation which is a congruence. This property yields a substantial improvement with respect to previous proposals by the same authors aimed at unifying the above two languages.

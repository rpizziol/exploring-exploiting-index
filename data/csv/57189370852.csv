10.1016/j.mechmat.2023.104810,0,"Backsheet is the outermost layer of the photovoltaic (PV) laminate which consists of polymers such as Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or Polyvinyl fluoride (PVF). The viscoelastic response of these materials significantly affects the durability of the PV module. In this study, the viscoelastic response of commercially available backsheet materials is experimentally characterized and computationally modeled. An extensive viscoelastic experimental study on backsheet materials is carried out, considering the temperature-dependent properties to characterize the mechanical properties. Based on an experimental campaign, small-strain viscoelastic models based on the Prony-series (PS) and Fractional Calculus (FC) are herein proposed. The form of the constitutive equations for both models is outlined, and the finite element implementation is described in detail. Following the identification of the relevant material parameters, models are validated with experimental data, showing good predictability. A comparative study of model responses under different loading conditions is also reported to assess the advantages and disadvantages of both models. Such an extensive experimental study and constitutive modeling will help design and simulate a more comprehensive digital-twin model of PV modules, as illustrated by the benchmark problems.","Dusane, A.

10.1002/nme.7233,0,"A comprehensive coupled thermo-chemo-mechanical modeling framework is proposed in this work to study the reaction-diffusion phenomena taking place inside photovoltaics (PV). When exposed to hygrothermal conditions, the encapsulant ethylene-co-vinyl acetate (EVA) layers undergo chemical degradation that significantly influences the overall PV performance. Aiming at efficient thermo-mechanical modeling, the coupled displacement-temperature governing equations for the EVA layers are formulated, and its 3D finite element (FE) implementation is derived in detail. Subsequently, the chemical reaction-diffusion processes occurring in the EVA layers are described, and the corresponding numerical implementation is formulated with the consideration of spatial and temporal variation of diffusivity and chemical kinetic rates. Specifically, the thermo-mechanical solution accounting for the heat generation from chemical reactions is projected to the FE model of the reaction-diffusion system in order to determine the kinetic rates and diffusion coefficients for its subsequent analysis. The proposed modeling method is applied to simulate the evolution of reaction-diffusion species at different damp heat tests, and predictions show a very satisfactory agreement with the analytical solution and experimental electroluminescence images taken from the literature. Its capabilities to predict the spatio-temporal variation are demonstrated through the simulation of the humidity freeze test, where the cyclic temperature boundary condition is imposed. With this modeling framework, it is possible to evaluate the degradation of PV modules under varying environmental boundary conditions, thus providing a guideline to design new products tailored for specific climatic zones.","Liu, Zeng;Lenarda, Pietro;Reinoso, Jose;Paggi, Marco",57368375800;57189370852;26644306500;35148174600
10.1016/j.engfracmech.2022.108949,2,"The main scope of the proposed study is to assess the occurrence of fracture in Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces (TPMS) foams subjected to compressive loading. TPMS, developed by the mathematics community, may be exploited as a backbone for developing a new class of foams with open porosity for a wide range of engineering and biomedical applications. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of their fracture response is fundamental and is herein attempted. To this aim, a 3D phase field model is herein proposed and applied to TPMS foam structures under compression, with the goal to predict critical points for crack nucleation, potential crack paths, and the stiffness and maximum force of the unit cell, which can be related to the apparent Young's modulus and apparent strength of a macro-scale composite made of such TPMS unit cells. A careful mesh sensitivity analysis was conducted on the specimens, to provide guidelines on how to identify the optimal finite element discretization consistent with the internal length scale parameter of the phase field approach to fracture. The major predicted mechanical properties for five different TPMS open foams, and for different levels of porosity, are summarized in Ashby plots. The predicted trends are in agreement with previous results on TPMS taken from the literature and show that TPMS can outperform standard Aluminium open foams.","Préve, Deison;Lenarda, Pietro;Maskery, Ian;Paggi, Marco",56913350400;57189370852;55053275100;35148174600
10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2022.111798,7,"Fracture growth in a material is strongly influenced by the presence of inhomogeneities, which deviate crack trajectories from rectilinearity and deeply affect failure. Increasing crack tortuosity is connected to enhancement of fracture toughness, while often a crack may even be stopped when it impinges a void, which releases the stress concentration. Therefore, the determination of crack trajectories is important in the design against failure of materials and mechanical components. The recently developed phase-field approach (AT1 and AT2 models), based on a variational approach to damage localization, is believed to be particularly suited to describe complex crack trajectories. This belief is examined through a comparison between simulations and photoelastic experiments on PMMA plates, which have been designed in a new way, to highlight the effects of notches and circular holes on fracture propagation. The latter is shown to initiate from a notch and to be strongly attracted by voids. When a void is hit, fracture is arrested, unless the void contains a notch on its internal surface, from which a new crack nucleates and propagates. Different mechanical models are tested where fracture initiates and grows (i.) under Mode I compact tension, (ii.) four-point bending and (iii.) a tensile stress indirectly generated during compression of samples containing a circular hole. The experiments show that the fracture propagation may be ‘designed’ to develop in different tortuous paths, involving multiple arrests and secondary nucleation. Simulations performed with an ad hoc implemented version of the AT1 and AT2 phase-field methods (equipped with spectral decomposition, in which a crack is simulated as a highly localized zone of damage accumulation) are shown to be in close agreement with experiments and therefore confirm the validity of the approach and its potentialities for mechanical design.","Cavuoto, R.;Lenarda, P.;Misseroni, D.;Paggi, M.;Bigoni, D.",57189519041;57189370852;41661769100;35148174600;7003362024
10.1016/j.tafmec.2022.103632,1,"The variational approach to brittle fracture is herein extended to deal with the simultaneous interplay of two failure mechanisms affecting grained heterogeneous materials in compression, namely fracture in tension and crushing in compression. The problem is addressed within the context of a multi-phase field variational approach, with two independent damage variables associated to each failure mechanism. The proposed computational method implemented in the open source FEniCS finite element software is applied to 2D mesoscale models of concrete specimens in compression. The predicted trends for specimens with different aspect ratios and different degree of lateral confinement are consistent with experimental results on apparent compressive strength and with typically observed failure patterns.","Lenarda, Pietro;Reinoso, José;Paggi, Marco",57189370852;26644306500;35148174600
10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2021.111297,4,"Fractional calculus has been proved to be very effective in representing the visco-elastic relaxation response of materials with memory such as polymers. Moreover, in modeling the temperature dependency of the material functions in thermo-visco-elasticity, the standard time–temperature superposition principle is known to be ineffective in most of the cases (thermo-rheological complexity). In this work, a novel finite element formulation and numerical implementation is proposed for the simulation of transient thermal analysis in thermo-rheologically complex materials. The parameters of the visco-elastic fractional constitutive law are assumed to be temperature dependent functions and an internal history variable is introduced to track the changes in temperature which are responsible for the phase transition of the material. The numerical approximation of the fractional derivative is employed via the so called Grünwald–Letnikov approximation. The proposed model is used to numerically solve some test cases related to relaxation and creep tests conducted on a real polymer (Ethylene Vinyl Acetate), which is used as the major encapsulant of solar cells in photovoltaics.","Lenarda, P.;Paggi, M.",57189370852;35148174600
10.1007/s40571-020-00362-1,4,"The FOSS CFD-SPH code SPHERA v.9.0.0 (RSE SpA) is improved to deal with “fluid–solid body” interactions under no-slip conditions and laminar regimes for the simulation of hydrodynamic lubrication. The code is herein validated in relation to a uniform slider bearing (i.e. for a constant lubricant film depth) and a linear slider bearing (i.e. for a film depth with a linear profile variation along the main flow direction). Validations refer to comparisons with analytical solutions, herein generalized to consider any Dirichlet boundary condition. Further, this study allows a first code validation of the “fluid–fixed frontier” interactions under no-slip conditions. With respect to the most state-of-the-art models (2D codes based on Reynolds’ equation for fluid films), the following distinctive features are highlighted: (1) 3D formulation on all the terms of the Navier–Stokes equations for incompressible fluids with uniform viscosity; (2) validations on both local and global quantities (pressure and velocity profiles; load-bearing capacity); (3) possibility to simulate any 3D topology. This study also shows the advantages of using a CFD-SPH code in simulating the inertia and 3D effects close to the slider edges, and it opens new research directions overcoming the limitations of the codes for hydrodynamic lubrication based on the Reynolds’ equation for fluid films. This study finally allows SPHERA to deal with hydrodynamic lubrication and improves the code for other relevant application fields involving fluid–structure interactions (e.g. transport of solid bodies by floods and earth landslides; rock landslides). SPHERA is developed and distributed on a GitHub public repository.","Paggi, Marco;Amicarelli, Andrea;Lenarda, Pietro",35148174600;25648807300;57189370852
10.1002/net.21992,0,"An important issue in social network analysis refers to the development of algorithms for estimating parameters of a social network model, using data available from the network itself. This entails solving an optimization problem. In the paper, we propose a new method for parameter estimation in a specific social network model, namely, the so-called p-star random graph model with three parameters. The method is based on the mean-field approximation of the moments associated with the three subgraphs defining the model, namely: the mean numbers of edges, 2-stars, and triangles. A modified gradient ascent method is applied to maximize the log-likelihood function of the p-star model, in which the components of the gradient are computed using approximate values of the moments. Compared to other existing iterative methods for parameter estimation, which are computationally very expensive when the number of vertices becomes large, such as gradient ascent applied to maximum log-likelihood and maximum log-pseudo-likelihood estimation, the proposed approach has the advantage of a much cheaper cost per iteration, which is practically independent of the number of vertices.","Lenarda, Pietro;Gnecco, Giorgio;Riccaboni, Massimo",57189370852;22953696000;6603650921
10.1016/j.tws.2020.107234,39,"A phase field (PF) approximation of fracture for functionally graded materials (FGM) using a diffusive crack approach incorporating the characteristic length scale as a material parameter is herein proposed. A rule of mixture is employed to estimate the material properties, according to the volume fractions of the constituent materials, which have been varied according to given grading profiles. In addition to the previous aspects, the current formulation includes the internal length scale of the phase field approach variable from point to point, to model a spatial variation of the material strength. Based on the ideas stemming from the study of size-scale effects, Γ-convergence for the proposed model is proved when the internal length scale is either constant or a bounded function. In a comprehensive sensitivity analysis, the effects of various model parameters for different grading profiles are analyzed. We first prove that the fracture energy and the elastic energy of FGM is bounded by their homogeneous constituents. Constitutive examples of boundary value problems solved using the BFGS solver are provided to bolster this claim. Finally, crack propagation events in conjunction with the differences with respect to their homogeneous surrogates are discussed through several representative applications, providing equivalence relationships for size-scale effects and demonstrating the applicability of the current model for structural analysis of FGMs.","Asur Vijaya Kumar, P.

10.3390/LUBRICANTS7120103,8,"Rough and textured surfaces are of paramount importance for lubrication, both in nature and in technology. While surface roughness relevantly influences both friction and wear, artificial surface texturing improves the performance of slider bearings as an energy efficiency action. The simulation of hydrodynamic lubrication by taking into account complex surfaces as boundaries requires the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software able to predict the pressure and the velocity profile through the thickness of the fluid and at any point within the 3D domain. In the present study, a CFD-smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code is applied to simulate hydrodynamic lubrication for a linear slider bearing in the presence of a 3D rough surface, showing the capabilities of CFD-SPH in modelling such complex interaction phenomena. Numerical assessments involve the load capacity, the 3D fields of the velocity vector, and the pressure 3D field (both within the fluid domain and at the fluid-plate interface).","Paggi, Marco;Amicarelli, Andrea;Lenarda, Pietro",35148174600;25648807300;57189370852
10.1007/s12195-019-00587-y,11,"Introduction: Distant spreading of primary lesions is modulated by the vascular dynamics of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and their ability to establish metastatic niches. While the mechanisms regulating CTC homing in specific tissues are yet to be elucidated, it is well documented that CTCs possess different size, biological properties and deformability. Methods: A computational model is presented to predict the vascular transport and adhesion of CTCs in whole blood. A Lattice–Boltzmann method, which is employed to solve the Navier-Stokes equation for the plasma flow, is coupled with an Immersed Boundary Method. Results: The vascular dynamics of a CTC is assessed in large and small microcapillaries. The CTC shear modulus kctc is varied returning CTCs that are stiffer, softer and equally deformable as compared to RBCs. In large microcapillaries, soft CTCs behave similarly to RBCs and move away from the vessel walls; whereas rigid CTCs are pushed laterally by the fast moving RBCs and interact with the vessel walls. Three adhesion behaviors are observed—firm adhesion, rolling and crawling over the vessel walls—depending on the CTC stiffness. On the contrary, in small microcapillaries, rigid CTCs are pushed downstream by a compact train of RBCs and cannot establish any firm interaction with the vessel walls; whereas soft CTCs are squeezed between the vessel wall and the RBC train and rapidly establish firm adhesion. Conclusions: These findings document the relevance of cell deformability in CTC vascular adhesion and provide insights on the mechanisms regulating metastasis formation in different vascular districts.","Lenarda, Pietro;Coclite, Alessandro;Decuzzi, Paolo",57189370852;56205042400;56884263000
10.1016/j.euromechsol.2018.06.001,17,"Cardiac myocytes are the fundamental cells composing the heart muscle. The propagation of electric signals and chemical quantities through them is responsible for their nonlinear contraction and dilatation. In this study, a theoretical model and a finite element formulation are proposed for the simulation of adhesive contact interactions between myocytes across the so-called gap junctions. A novel multi-field interface constitutive law is proposed for their description, integrating the adhesive and contact mechanical response with their nonlinear electrophysiological behavior. From the computational point of view, the initial and boundary value problem is formulated as a structure-structure interaction problem, which leads to a straightforward implementation in the finite element software. Numerical tests are conducted on different couples of myocytes, characterized by different shapes related to their stages of growth, qualitatively capturing the experimental response in terms of tractions and displacement gaps at the interface. The proposed framework will represent a base reference model to investigate imperfect mechano-transduction between excitable deformable media and to understand how such complex nonlinear multiscale interactions affect the onset of emergent pathological scenarios, e.g. cardiac arrhythmias.","Lenarda, Pietro;Gizzi, Alessio;Paggi, Marco",57189370852;35758628800;35148174600

The space discretisation of the governing equations is based on mixed finite element methods defined on unstructured meshes, whereas the time integration hinges on an operator splitting strategy that exploits the differences in scales between the reaction, advection, and diffusion processes, considering the global system as a number of sequentially linked sets of partial differential, and algebraic equations. The flow solver presents the advantage that all unknowns in the system (here vorticity, velocity, and pressure) can be fully decoupled and thus turn the overall scheme very attractive from the computational perspective.

10.1016/j.solmat.2017.02.014,53,"Among polymers used as encapsulant in photovoltaic (PV) modules, poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate), or EVA, is the most widely used, for its low cost and acceptable performances. When exposed to weather conditions, EVA undergoes degradation that affects overall PV performances. Durability prediction of EVA, and thus of the module, is a hot topic in PV process industry. To date, the literature lacks of long-term predictive computational models to study EVA aging. To fill this gap, a computational framework, based on the finite element method, is proposed to simulate chemical reactions and diffusion processes occurring in EVA. The developed computational framework is valid in either case of environmental or accelerated aging. The proposed framework enables the identification of a correspondence between induced degradation in accelerated tests and actual exposure in weathering conditions. The developed tool is useful for the prediction of the spatio-temporal evolution of the chemical species in EVA, affecting its optical properties. The obtained predictions, related to degradation kinetics and discoloration, show a very good correlation with experimental data taken from the literature, confirming the validity of the proposed formulation and computational approach. The framework has the potential to provide quantitative comparisons of degradation resulting from any environmental condition to that gained from accelerated aging tests, also providing a guideline to design new testing protocols tailored for specific climatic zones.","Gagliardi, M.;Lenarda, P.;Paggi, M.",57213336597;57189370852;35148174600
10.1007/s00466-016-1271-5,14,"A comprehensive computational framework based on the finite element method for the simulation of coupled hygro-thermo-mechanical problems in photovoltaic laminates is herein proposed. While the thermo-mechanical problem takes place in the three-dimensional space of the laminate, moisture diffusion occurs in a two-dimensional domain represented by the polymeric layers and by the vertical channel cracks in the solar cells. Therefore, a geometrical multi-scale solution strategy is pursued by solving the partial differential equations governing heat transfer and thermo-elasticity in the three-dimensional space, and the partial differential equation for moisture diffusion in the two dimensional domains. By exploiting a staggered scheme, the thermo-mechanical problem is solved first via a fully implicit solution scheme in space and time, with a specific treatment of the polymeric layers as zero-thickness interfaces whose constitutive response is governed by a novel thermo-visco-elastic cohesive zone model based on fractional calculus. Temperature and relative displacements along the domains where moisture diffusion takes place are then projected to the finite element model of diffusion, coupled with the thermo-mechanical problem by the temperature and crack opening dependent diffusion coefficient. The application of the proposed method to photovoltaic modules pinpoints two important physical aspects: (i) moisture diffusion in humidity freeze tests with a temperature dependent diffusivity is a much slower process than in the case of a constant diffusion coefficient; (ii) channel cracks through Silicon solar cells significantly enhance moisture diffusion and electric degradation, as confirmed by experimental tests.","Lenarda, P.;Paggi, M.",57189370852;35148174600
10.2140/memocs.2016.4.407,2,"This paper focuses on the relation between Gibbs and Markov random fields, one instance of the close relation between abstract and applied mathematics so often stressed by Lucio Russo in his scientific work. We start by proving a more explicit version, based on spin products, of the Hammersley-Clifford theorem, a classic result which identifies Gibbs andMarkov fields under finite energy. Then we argue that the celebrated counterexample of Moussouris, intended to show that there is no complete coincidence between Markov and Gibbs random fields in the presence of hard-core constraints, is not really such. In fact, the notion of a constrained Gibbs random field used in the example and in the subsequent literature makes the unnatural assumption that the constraints are infinite energy Gibbs interactions on the same graph. Here we consider the more natural extended version of the equivalence problem, in which constraints are more generally based on a possibly larger graph, and solve it. The bearing of the more natural approach is shown by considering identifiability of discrete random fields from support, conditional independencies and corresponding moments. In fact, by means of our previous results, we show identifiability for a large class of problems, and also examples with no identifiability. Various open questions surface along the way.","Gandolfi, Alberto;Lenarda, Pietro",16419630300;57189370852

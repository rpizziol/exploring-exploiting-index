10.1103/PhysRevE.108.024313,0,"We present a comparison between various algorithms of inference of covariance and precision matrices in small data sets of real vectors of the typical length and dimension of human brain activity time series retrieved by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Assuming a Gaussian model underlying the neural activity, the problem consists of denoising the empirically observed matrices to obtain a better estimator of the (unknown) true precision and covariance matrices. We consider several standard noise-cleaning algorithms and compare them on two types of data sets. The first type consists of synthetic time series sampled from a generative Gaussian model of which we can vary the fraction of dimensions per sample q and the strength of off-diagonal correlations. The second type consists of time series of fMRI brain activity of human subjects at rest. The reliability of each algorithm is assessed in terms of test-set likelihood and, in the case of synthetic data, of the distance from the true precision matrix. We observe that the so-called optimal rotationally invariant estimator, based on random matrix theory, leads to a significantly lower distance from the true precision matrix in synthetic data and higher test likelihood in natural fMRI data. We propose a variant of the optimal rotationally invariant estimator in which one of its parameters is optimzed by cross-validation. In the severe undersampling regime (large q) typical of fMRI series, it outperforms all the other estimators. We furthermore propose a simple algorithm based on an iterative likelihood gradient ascent, leading to very accurate estimations in weakly correlated synthetic data sets.","Ibáñez-Berganza, Miguel;Lucibello, Carlo;Santucci, Francesca;Gili, Tommaso;Gabrielli, Andrea",54974028100;55965462000;57462088800;13310221100;57222737548
10.7717/peerj.10210,0,"The perception of facial attractiveness is a complex phenomenon which depends on how the observer perceives not only individual facial features, but also their mutual influence and interplay. In the machine learning community, this problem is typically tackled as a problem of regression of the subject-averaged rating assigned to natural faces. However, it has been conjectured that this approach does not capture the complexity of the phenomenon. It has recently been shown that different human subjects can navigate the face-space and ‘‘sculpt’’ their preferred modification of a reference facial portrait. Here we present an unsupervised inference study of the set of sculpted facial vectors in such experiments. We first infer minimal, interpretable and accurate probabilistic models (through Maximum Entropy and artificial neural networks) of the preferred facial variations, that encode the inter-subject variance. The application of such generative models to the supervised classification of the gender of the subject that sculpted the face reveals that it may be predicted with astonishingly high accuracy. We observe that the classification accuracy improves by increasing the order of the non-linear effective interaction. This suggests that the cognitive mechanisms related to facial discrimination in the brain do not involve the positions of single facial landmarks only, but mainly the mutual influence of couples, and even triplets and quadruplets of landmarks. Furthermore, the high prediction accuracy of the subjects’ gender suggests that much relevant information regarding the subjects may influence (and be elicited from) their facial preference criteria, in agreement with the multiple motive theory of attractiveness proposed in previous works.","Ibanez-Berganza, Miguel;Amico, Ambra;Lancia, Gian Luca;Maggiore, Federico;Monechi, Bernardo;Loreto, Vittorio",54974028100;57209279663;57522718400;57219722641;36961183500;7004031964
10.1098/rsos.200667,3,"The rapid urbanization makes the understanding of the evolution of urban environments of utmost importance to steer societies towards better futures. Many studies have focused on the emerging properties of cities, leading to the discovery of scaling laws mirroring the dependence of socio-economic indicators on city sizes. However, few efforts have been devoted to the modelling of the dynamical evolution of cities, as reflected through the mutual influence of socio-economic variables. Here, we fill this gap by presenting a maximum entropy generative model for cities written in terms of a few macro-economic variables, whose parameters (the effective Hamiltonian, in a statistical-physical analogy) are inferred from real data through a maximum-likelihood approach. This approach allows for establishing a few results. First, nonlinear dependencies among indicators are needed for an accurate statistical description of the complexity of empirical correlations. Second, the inferred coupling parameters turn out to be quite robust along different years. Third, the quasi time-invariance of the effective Hamiltonian allows guessing the future state of a city based on a previous state. Through the adoption of a longitudinal dataset of macro-economic variables for French towns, we assess a significant forecasting accuracy.","Monechi, Bernardo;Ibáñez-Berganza, Miguel;Loreto, Vittorio",36961183500;54974028100;7004031964
10.1038/s41598-019-44655-9,24,"The origin and meaning of facial beauty represent a longstanding puzzle. Despite the profuse literature devoted to facial attractiveness, its very nature, its determinants and the nature of inter-person differences remain controversial issues. Here we tackle such questions proposing a novel experimental approach in which human subjects, instead of rating natural faces, are allowed to efficiently explore the face-space and “sculpt” their favorite variation of a reference facial image. The results reveal that different subjects prefer distinguishable regions of the face-space, highlighting the essential subjectivity of the phenomenon. The different sculpted facial vectors exhibit strong correlations among pairs of facial distances, characterising the underlying universality and complexity of the cognitive processes, and the relative relevance and robustness of the different facial distances.","Ibáñez-Berganza, Miguel;Amico, Ambra;Loreto, Vittorio",54974028100;57209279663;7004031964
10.1103/PhysRevB.100.054203,9,"The critical behavior of statistical models with long-range interactions exhibits distinct regimes as a function of ρ, the power of the interaction strength decay. For large enough ρ, ρ>ρsr, the critical behavior is observed to coincide with that of the short-range model. However, there are controversial aspects regarding this picture, one of which is the value of the short-range threshold ρsr in the case of the long-range XY model in two dimensions. We study the 2D XY model on the diluted graph, a sparse graph obtained from the 2D lattice by rewiring links with probability decaying with the Euclidean distance of the lattice as |r|-ρ, which is expected to feature the same critical behavior of the long-range model. Through Monte Carlo sampling and finite-size analysis of the spontaneous magnetization and of the Binder cumulant, we present numerical evidence that ρsr=4. According to such a result, one expects the model to belong to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class for ρ≥4, and to present a second-order transition for ρ<4.","Cescatti, Fabiana;Ibáñez-Berganza, Miguel;Vezzani, Alessandro;Burioni, Raffaella",57210961056;54974028100;7006829921;7004828274
10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.098102,13,"A collective chaotic phase with power law scaling of activity events is observed in a disordered mean field network of purely excitatory leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with short-term synaptic plasticity. The dynamical phase diagram exhibits two transitions from quasisynchronous and asynchronous regimes to the nontrivial, collective, bursty regime with avalanches. In the homogeneous case without disorder, the system synchronizes and the bursty behavior is reflected into a period doubling transition to chaos for a two dimensional discrete map. Numerical simulations show that the bursty chaotic phase with avalanches exhibits a spontaneous emergence of persistent time correlations and enhanced Kolmogorov complexity. Our analysis reveals a mechanism for the generation of irregular avalanches that emerges from the combination of disorder and deterministic underlying chaotic dynamics.","Pittorino, Fabrizio;Ibáñez-Berganza, Miguel;Di Volo, Matteo;Vezzani, Alessandro;Burioni, Raffaella",56426606100;54974028100;55629050400;7006829921;7004828274
10.1080/14786435.2016.1145359,32,"Referring to recent approaches to multimode laser theory, including Monte Carlo simulations of effective models and statistical mechanical analytic computations, the status for a complete nonperturbative theory in open and disordered cavities is discussed and the derivation of the general statistical models in this framework is presented. When light is propagating in a disordered medium, the relevant models can be analysed via the replica method. For high degrees of disordered-induced frustration and nonlinearity, a glassy behaviour is expected beyond the lasing threshold, providing a suggestive link between glasses and photonics. We describe in detail the results for the general Hamiltonian model in the mean field approximation and we analytically justify an available test for replica symmetry breaking from intensity spectra measurements.

10.1088/1742-5468/2016/05/053112,5,"Entanglement between different regions in momentum space is studied for ground states of some spin-chain Hamiltonians: the XY model, the Ising model in a transverse field (ITF) and the XXZ models. In the XY and ITF cases, entanglement only takes place between states with opposite momenta. Thus, an anisotropy in the interaction induces entanglement in the momentum pairs. In the ITF case, the ferromagnetic phase is characterized by a total entropy between left- and right-moving modes which is independent of the external field. This result characterizes the Ising phase transition in momentum space. In the critical XXZ case, we provide evidence that the maximal entropy between energy modes around the Fermi point grows logarithmically with the system size, with a prefactor which depends on the compactification radius. The slow growth of the entanglement in Fourier space with the system size lies at the origin of the success of the renormalization techniques in momentum space.","Ibáñez-Berganza, Miguel;Rodríguez-Laguna, Javier;Sierra, Germán",54974028100;6507095229;35616503200
10.1209/0295-5075/113/26002,0,"We present a phenomenological theory describing the finite-size evaporation-condensation transition of the q-state Potts model in the microcanonical ensemble. Our arguments rely on the existence of an exponent σ, relating the surface and the volume of the condensed phase droplet. The evaporation-condensation transition temperature and energy converge to their infinite-size values with the same power, a = (1 - σ)/(2 - σ), of the inverse of the system size. For the 2D Potts model we show, by means of efficient simulations up to q = 24 and 10242 sites, that the exponent a is compatible with 1/4, assuming assymptotic finite-size convergence. While this value cannot be addressed by the evaporation-condensation theory developed for the Ising model, it is obtained in the present scheme if σ = 2/3, in agreement with previous theoretical guesses. The connection with the phenomenon of metastability in the canonical ensemble is also discussed.","Ibáñez-Berganza, M.",54974028100
10.1103/PhysRevB.92.014204,20,"The thermodynamic properties of vector [O(2) and complex spherical] models with four-body interactions are analyzed. When defined in dense topologies, these are effective models for the nonlinear interaction of scalar fields in the presence of a stochastic noise, as has been well established for the case of the mode-locking laser formation in a closed cavity. With the help of an efficient Monte Carlo algorithm we show how, beyond the fully connected case, rich phenomenology emerges. Below a certain dilution threshold, the spherical model condenses in a nonequipartite way, while in the XY model the transition becomes continuous and the O(2) symmetry remains unbroken. We attribute this fact to the invariance under gauge transformations. The introduction of topological inhomogeneities in the network of quadruplets induces some features: again symmetry conservation; the vanishing of two-point correlators; and a dynamical correlation function presenting two time scales, the large one being related to the transition between different degenerated configurations, connected by particular gauge transformations. We discuss possible experimental implications of these results in the context of nonlinear optics.","Antenucci, F.;Ibáñez Berganza, M.;Leuzzi, L.",56078924200;54974028100;55886521200

10.1103/PhysRevA.91.043811,16,"A study of the mode-locking lasing pulse formation in closed cavities is presented within a statistical-mechanical framework where the onset of laser coincides with a thermodynamic phase transition driven by the optical power pumped into the system. Electromagnetic modes are represented by classical degrees of freedom of a Hamiltonian model at equilibrium in an effective ensemble corresponding to the stationary laser regime. By means of optimized Monte Carlo numerical simulations, the system properties are analyzed while varying mode interaction dilution, gain profile, and number of modes. Properties of the resulting mode-locking laser phase are presented that were not observed in previous approaches based on mean-field approximations. For strong dilution of the nonlinear interaction network, power condensation occurs as the total optical intensity is taken by a few electromagnetic modes, whose number does not depend on the size of the system. For all reported cases, laser thresholds, intensity spectra, phase waves, and ultrafast electromagnetic pulses are computed.","Antenucci, F.;Berganza, M.

,0,"The adoption of a statistical mechanical framework in optics provides realistic models for multimode laser systems, whose experimental implications are presented and critically analyzed. A model for passive mode locking lasers is analyzed beyond the mean-field approximation, accounting for the presence of many well-resolved frequencies of the lasing modes. The inhomogeneous structure in the nonlinear ""mode locked"" interaction network is shown to yield short pulses and phase waves with nontrivial slopes, corresponding to a phase delay of the pulsed laser signal. The analytic solution of a mean field-model for multimode laser in open and irregular cavities will be, afterwards, addressed. The complete phase diagram, in terms of degree of disorder, pumping rate of the source and strength of nonlinearity, consists of four different photonic regimes: incoherent fluorescence, mode locking, random lasing and the novel ""phase locking wave"". A replica symmetry breaking transition occurs at the random lasing threshold. For a high enough strength of nonlinearity, a whole region with nonvanishing complexity anticipates the transition and the light in the disordered medium displays typical glassy behavior.","Antenucci, F.;Crisanti, A.;Ibáñez Berganza, M.;Leuzzi, L.",56078924200;57203254122;54974028100;55886521200

The number of levels presenting maximal entanglement is shown to estimate the number of Cooper pairs involved in pairing correlations.

An immediate further step is to apply it to the study of a transition driven by the temperature, as the one exhibited by the two-dimensional Potts model. For this model, a study based on the analytical continuation of the free energy (Meunier J. L. and Morel A., Eur. Phys. J. B, 13 (2000) 341) predicts the anomalous vanishing of the metastable temperature range in the large-system-size limit, an issue that has been controversial since the eighties. By a GPU algorithm we compare the Monte Carlo dynamics with the theory.

10.1111/tpj.13472,75,"Phenotyping is important to understand plant biology, but current solutions are costly, not versatile or are difficult to deploy. To solve this problem, we present Phenotiki, an affordable system for plant phenotyping that, relying on off-the-shelf parts, provides an easy to install and maintain platform, offering an out-of-box experience for a well-established phenotyping need: imaging rosette-shaped plants. The accompanying software (with available source code) processes data originating from our device seamlessly and automatically. Our software relies on machine learning to devise robust algorithms, and includes an automated leaf count obtained from 2D images without the need of depth (3D). Our affordable device (~€200) can be deployed in growth chambers or greenhouse to acquire optical 2D images of approximately up to 60 adult Arabidopsis rosettes concurrently. Data from the device are processed remotely on a workstation or via a cloud application (based on CyVerse). In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept validation experiment on top-view images of 24 Arabidopsis plants in a combination of genotypes that has not been compared previously. Phenotypic analysis with respect to morphology, growth, color and leaf count has not been performed comprehensively before now. We confirm the findings of others on some of the extracted traits, showing that we can phenotype at reduced cost. We also perform extensive validations with external measurements and with higher fidelity equipment, and find no loss in statistical accuracy when we use the affordable setting that we propose. Device set-up instructions and analysis software are publicly available (http://phenotiki.com).","Minervini, Massimo;Giuffrida, Mario V.;Perata, Pierdomenico;Tsaftaris, Sotirios A.",55641693800;56605978200;7004600627;6505952824

10.1016/j.patrec.2015.10.013,166,"Image-based approaches to plant phenotyping are gaining momentum providing fertile ground for several interesting vision tasks where fine-grained categorization is necessary, such as leaf segmentation among a variety of cultivars, and cultivar (or mutant) identification. However, benchmark data focusing on typical imaging situations and vision tasks are still lacking, making it difficult to compare existing methodologies. This paper describes a collection of benchmark datasets of raw and annotated top-view color images of rosette plants. We briefly describe plant material, imaging setup and procedures for different experiments: one with various cultivars of Arabidopsis and one with tobacco undergoing different treatments. We proceed to define a set of computer vision and classification tasks and provide accompanying datasets and annotations based on our raw data. We describe the annotation process performed by experts and discuss appropriate evaluation criteria. We also offer exemplary use cases and results on some tasks obtained with parts of these data. We hope with the release of this rigorous dataset collection to invigorate the development of algorithms in the context of plant phenotyping but also provide new interesting datasets for the general computer vision community to experiment on.

10.1007/s00138-015-0737-3,201,"Image-based plant phenotyping is a growing application area of computer vision in agriculture. A key task is the segmentation of all individual leaves in images. Here we focus on the most common rosette model plants, Arabidopsis and young tobacco. Although leaves do share appearance and shape characteristics, the presence of occlusions and variability in leaf shape and pose, as well as imaging conditions, render this problem challenging. The aim of this paper is to compare several leaf segmentation solutions on a unique and first-of-its-kind dataset containing images from typical phenotyping experiments. In particular, we report and discuss methods and findings of a collection of submissions for the first Leaf Segmentation Challenge of the Computer Vision Problems in Plant Phenotyping workshop in 2014. Four methods are presented: three segment leaves by processing the distance transform in an unsupervised fashion, and the other via optimal template selection and Chamfer matching. Overall, we find that although separating plant from background can be accomplished with satisfactory accuracy (> 90 % Dice score), individual leaf segmentation and counting remain challenging when leaves overlap. Additionally, accuracy is lower for younger leaves. We find also that variability in datasets does affect outcomes. Our findings motivate further investigations and development of specialized algorithms for this particular application, and that challenges of this form are ideally suited for advancing the state of the art. Data are publicly available (online at http://www.plant-phenotyping.org/datasets) to support future challenges beyond segmentation within this application domain.","Scharr, Hanno;Minervini, Massimo;French, Andrew P.;Klukas, Christian;Kramer, David M.;Liu, Xiaoming;Luengo, Imanol;Pape, Jean Michel;Polder, Gerrit;Vukadinovic, Danijela;Yin, Xi;Tsaftaris, Sotirios A.",23393543900;55641693800;7202095090;56121378200;57218790028;35793096800;57000261300;55418328500;55884050600;55907345500;56288395400;6505952824
10.1177/1094342013519483,7,"The combined use of mice that have genetic mutations (transgenic mouse models) of human pathology and advanced neuroimaging methods (such as magnetic resonance imaging) has the potential to radically change how we approach disease understanding, diagnosis and treatment. Morphological changes occurring in the brain of transgenic animals as a result of the interaction between environment and genotype can be assessed using advanced image analysis methods, an effort described as 'mouse brain phenotyping'. However, the computational methods involved in the analysis of high-resolution brain images are demanding. While running such analysis on local clusters is possible, not all users have access to such infrastructure and even for those that do, having additional computational capacity can be beneficial (e.g. to meet sudden high throughput demands). In this paper we use a commercial cloud platform for brain neuroimaging and analysis. We achieve a registration-based multi-atlas, multi-template anatomical segmentation, normally a lengthy-in-time effort, within a few hours. Naturally, performing such analyses on the cloud entails a monetary cost, and it is worthwhile identifying strategies that can allocate resources intelligently. In our context a critical aspect is the identification of how long each job will take. We propose a method that estimates the complexity of an image-processing task, a registration, using statistical moments and shape descriptors of the image content. We use this information to learn and predict the completion time of a registration. The proposed approach is easy to deploy, and could serve as an alternative for laboratories that may require instant access to large high-performance-computing infrastructures. To facilitate adoption from the community we publicly release the source code.","Minervini, Massimo;Rusu, Cristian;Damiano, Mario;Tucci, Valter;Bifone, Angelo;Gozzi, Alessandro;Tsaftaris, Sotirios A.",55641693800;56281054700;23974280900;15020061200;7004669829;6602786023;6505952824
10.1109/MSP.2015.2405111,174,"Plant phenotyping is the identification of effects on the phenotype (i.e., the plant appearance and performance) as a result of genotype differences (i.e., differences in the genetic code) and the environmental conditions to which a plant has been exposed [1]?[3]. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, large-scale experiments in plant phenotyping are a key factor in meeting the agricultural needs of the future to feed the world and provide biomass for energy, while using less water, land, and fertilizer under a constantly evolving environment due to climate change. Working on model plants (such as Arabidopsis), combined with remarkable advances in genotyping, has revolutionized our understanding of biology but has accelerated the need for precision and automation in phenotyping, favoring approaches that provide quantifiable phenotypic information that could be better used to link and find associations in the genotype [4]. While early on, the collection of phenotypes was manual, currently noninvasive, imaging-based methods are increasingly being utilized [5], [6]. However, the rate at which phenotypes are extracted in the field or in the lab is not matching the speed of genotyping and is creating a bottleneck [1].","Minervini, Massimo;Scharr, Hanno;Tsaftaris, Sotirios A.",55641693800;23393543900;6505952824
10.1007/978-3-319-09363-5_13,3,"An important step in color image or video coding and enhancement is the linear transformation of input (typically red-green-blue (RGB)) data into a color space more suitable for compression, subsequent analysis, or visualization. The choice of this transform becomes even more critical when operating in distributed and low-computational power environments, such as visual sensor networks or remote sensing. Data-driven transforms are rarely used due to increased complexity. Most schemes adopt fixed transforms to decorrelate the color channels which are then processed independently. Here we propose two frameworks to find appropriate data-driven transforms in different settings. The first, named approximate Karhunen-Loève Transform (aKLT), performs comparable to the KLT at a fraction of the computational complexity, thus favoring adoption on sensors and resource-constrained devices. Furthermore, we consider an application-aware setting in which an expert system (e.g., a classifier) analyzes imaging data at the receiver’s end. In a compression context, distortion may jeopardize the accuracy of the analysis. Since the KLT is not optimal in this setting, we investigate formulations that maximize post-compression expert system performance. Relaxing decorrelation and energy compactness constraints, a second transform can be obtained offline with supervised learning methods. Finally, we propose transforms that accommodate both constraints, and are found using regularized optimization.","Minervini, Massimo;Rusu, Cristian;Tsaftaris, Sotirios A.",55641693800;56281054700;6505952824
10.1109/VCIP.2015.7457877,2,"Increasingly many vision applications necessitate the transmission of acquired images and video to a remote location for automated processing. When the image data are consumed by analysis algorithms and possibly never seen by a human, tailoring compression to the application is beneficial from a bit rate perspective. We inject prior knowledge of the application in the encoder to make rate-distortion decisions based on an estimate of the accuracy that will be achieved when analyzing reconstructed image data. Focusing on classification (e.g., used for image segmentation), we propose a new application-aware distortion metric based on a geometric interpretation of classification error. We devise an implementation for the High Efficiency Video Coding standard, and derive optimal model parameters for the A-domain rate control algorithm by curve fitting procedures. We evaluate our approach on time-lapse sequences from plant phenotyping experiments and cell fluorescence microscopy encoded in intra-only mode, observing a reduction in segmentation error across bit rates.","Minervini, Massimo;Tsaftaris, Sotirios A.",55641693800;6505952824
10.1071/FP15033,12,"We are currently witnessing an increasingly higher throughput in image-based plant phenotyping experiments. The majority of imaging data are collected using complex automated procedures and are then post-processed to extract phenotyping-related information. In this article, we show that the image compression used in such procedures may compromise phenotyping results and this needs to be taken into account. We use three illuminating proof-of-concept experiments that demonstrate that compression (especially in the most common lossy JPEG form) affects measurements of plant traits and the errors introduced can be high. We also systematically explore how compression affects measurement fidelity, quantified as effects on image quality, as well as errors in extracted plant visual traits. To do so, we evaluate a variety of image-based phenotyping scenarios, including size and colour of shoots, leaf and root growth. To show that even visual impressions can be used to assess compression effects, we use root system images as examples. Overall, we find that compression has a considerable effect on several types of analyses (albeit visual or quantitative) and that proper care is necessary to ensure that this choice does not affect biological findings. In order to avoid or at least minimise introduced measurement errors, for each scenario, we derive recommendations and provide guidelines on how to identify suitable compression options in practice. We also find that certain compression choices can offer beneficial returns in terms of reducing the amount of data storage without compromising phenotyping results. This may enable even higher throughput experiments in the future.","Minervini, Massimo;Scharr, Hanno;Tsaftaris, Sotirios A.",55641693800;23393543900;6505952824

Relaxing energy compactness constraints, we propose for the first time a transform which can be found offline optimizing the Fisher discrimination criterion in a supervised fashion. In lieu of channel decorrelation, we obtain spatial decorrelation using the same color transform as a rudimentary classifier to detect objects of interest in the input image without adding any computational cost. We achieve higher savings encoding these regions at a higher quality, when combined with region-of-interest capable encoders, such as JPEG 2000.","Minervini, Massimo;Rusu, Cristian;Tsaftaris, Sotirios A.",55641693800;56281054700;6505952824
10.1016/j.ecoinf.2013.07.004,94,"Plant phenotyping investigates how a plant's genome, interacting with the environment, affects the observable traits of a plant (phenome). It is becoming increasingly important in our quest towards efficient and sustainable agriculture. While sequencing the genome is becoming increasingly efficient, acquiring phenotype information has remained largely of low throughput. Current solutions for automated image-based plant phenotyping, rely either on semi-automated or manual analysis of the imaging data, or on expensive and proprietary software which accompanies costly hardware infrastructure. While some attempts have been made to create software applications that enable the analysis of such images in an automated fashion, most solutions are tailored to particular acquisition scenarios and restrictions on experimental design. In this paper we propose and test, a method for the segmentation and the automated analysis of time-lapse plant images from phenotyping experiments in a general laboratory setting, that can adapt to scene variability. The method involves minimal user interaction, necessary to establish the statistical experiments that may follow. At every time instance (i.e., a digital photograph), it segments the plants in images that contain many specimens of the same species. For accurate plant segmentation we propose a vector valued level set formulation that incorporates features of color intensity, local texture, and prior knowledge. Prior knowledge is incorporated using a plant appearance model implemented with Gaussian mixture models, which utilizes incrementally information from previously segmented instances. The proposed approach is tested on Arabidopsis plant images acquired with a static camera capturing many subjects at the same time. Our validation with ground truth segmentations and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods in the literature shows that the proposed method is able to handle images with complicated and changing background in an automated fashion. An accuracy of 96.7% (dice similarity coefficient) was observed, which was higher than other methods used for comparison. While here it was tested on a single plant species, the fact that we do not employ shape driven models and we do not rely on fully supervised classification (trained on a large dataset) increases the ease of deployment of the proposed solution for the study of different plant species in a variety of laboratory settings. Our solution will be accompanied by an easy to use graphical user interface and, to facilitate adoption, we will make the software available to the scientific community. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Minervini, Massimo;Abdelsamea, Mohammed M.;Tsaftaris, Sotirios A.",55641693800;55837497100;6505952824

It is becoming increasingly important in our quest towards efficient and sustainable agriculture. While sequencing the genome is becoming increasingly efficient, acquiring phenotype information has remained largely of low throughput, since high throughput solutions are costly and not widespread. A distributed approach could provide a low cost solution, offering high accuracy and throughput. A sensor of low computational power acquires time-lapse images of plants and sends them to an analysis system with higher computational and storage capacity (e.g., a service running on a cloud infrastructure). However, such system requires the transmission of imaging data from sensor to receiver, which necessitates their lossy compression to reduce bandwidth requirements. In this paper, we propose an application aware image compression approach where the sensor is aware of its context (i.e., imaging plants) and takes advantage of the feedback from the receiver to focus bitrate on regions of interest (ROI). We use JPEG 2000 with ROI coding, and thus remain standard compliant, and offer a solution that is low cost and has low computational requirements. We evaluate our solution in several images of Arabidopsis thaliana phenotyping experiments, and we show that both for traditional metrics (such as PSNR) and application aware metrics, the performance of the proposed solution provides a 70% reduction of bitrate for equivalent performance. © 2013 IEEE.","Minervini, Massimo;Tsaftaris, Sotirios A.",55641693800;6505952824
10.1109/ispa.2013.6703715,5,"Image segmentation metrics have been extensively used in the literature to compare segmentation algorithms among each other, or relative to a ground-truth segmentation. Some metrics are easy to compute (e.g., Dice, Jaccard), others are more accurate (e.g., the Hausdorff distance) and may reflect local topology, but they are computationally demanding. While certain attempts have been made to create computationally efficient implementations of such complex metrics, in this paper we approach this problem from a radically different viewpoint. We construct approximations of a complex metric (e.g., the Hausdorff distance), combining a small number of computationally lightweight metrics in a linear regression model. We also consider feature selection, using sparsity inducing strategies, to restrict the number of metrics employed significantly, without penalizing the predictive power of the model. We demonstrate our methodology with image data from plant phenotyping experiments. We find that a linear model can effectively approximate the Hausdorff distance using even a few features.

10.1038/s41598-023-45425-4,0,"This work presents the first attempt to create a physics-based digital twin model for predictive analysis of damage evolution during the use of ground stone tools (GSTs) in transformative tasks, encompassing the processing of raw resources for nutritional and non-alimentary purposes. The proposed methodology introduces a digital twin of the GSTs developed from 3D models generated using a photogrammetric technique based on Structure-from-Motion and Multi-View Stereo reconstruction. These models serve as the foundation for the development of the finite element (FE)-based digital twin model of the GSTs that exploits a contact formulation and the phase-field approach to simulate tool damage during pounding and grinding tasks. Defining the initial relative positions of the stones, their mechanical behaviour, and controlling the movement of the active stone in a way as close as possible to the real one, the digital twin model has been devised to evaluate how the surface damage is affected by perturbations in the loading conditions. The simulated damage is compared with the surface traces observed from experiments. The developed digital twin model aims at demonstrating its potentials for the GSTs investigations, as a supporting tool for experiments and for simulated tests on the archaeological records.","Marulli, Maria Rosaria;Sorrentino, Giusi;Menna, Fabio;Paggi, Marco",57215922167;57222500375;35976590400;35148174600

The viscoelastic response of these materials significantly affects the durability of the PV module. In this study, the viscoelastic response of commercially available backsheet materials is experimentally characterized and computationally modeled. An extensive viscoelastic experimental study on backsheet materials is carried out, considering the temperature-dependent properties to characterize the mechanical properties. Based on an experimental campaign, small-strain viscoelastic models based on the Prony-series (PS) and Fractional Calculus (FC) are herein proposed. The form of the constitutive equations for both models is outlined, and the finite element implementation is described in detail. Following the identification of the relevant material parameters, models are validated with experimental data, showing good predictability. A comparative study of model responses under different loading conditions is also reported to assess the advantages and disadvantages of both models. Such an extensive experimental study and constitutive modeling will help design and simulate a more comprehensive digital-twin model of PV modules, as illustrated by the benchmark problems.","Dusane, A.

10.1016/j.tafmec.2023.104029,0,"A computational framework to model fatigue fracture in structures based on the phase-field method and the solid-shell concept is herein presented. With the aim of achieving a locking free solid-shell finite element formulation with fracture-prediction capabilities, both the combination of the Enhanced Assumed Strain (EAS) and Assumed Natural Strain (ANS) methods with phase field of fracture is exploited. In order to achieve realistic prediction, the crack driving force is computed using positive/negative split of the stress field. Moreover, the difference between the driving forces are pinpointed. Furthermore, based on thermodynamic considerations, the free energy function is modified to introduce the fatigue effect via a degradation of the material fracture toughness. This approach retrieves the SN curves and the crack growth curve as expected. The predictive capability of the model is evaluated through benchmark examples that include a plate with a notch, a curved shell, mode II shear, and three-point bending for homogeneous materials, as well as a dogbone specimen for homogenized fiber-reinforced composites. Additionally, comparative analysis is performed with previous results for the plate with notch and mode II shear tests, while the dogbone specimen is compared with experimental data to further validate the accuracy of the present model.","Asur Vijaya Kumar, Pavan Kumar;Dean, Aamir;Reinoso, José;Pettermann, Heinz E.;Paggi, Marco",57217683184;57146512200;26644306500;6603677057;35148174600
10.1016/j.tafmec.2023.104005,0,"The classical Phase Field (PF) model for fracture mechanics of brittle materials based on the finite element method involves three parameters in addition to the Poisson ratio ν: the Young's modulus E, the fracture toughness Gc, and the internal length scale lc. The latter is mathematically conceived as a numerical regularization parameter that should tend to zero to recover linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) predictions. To address this issue, a robust algorithm is implemented in MATLAB, which combines Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and the Phase Field (PF) approach to fracture based on the finite element method. The algorithm has been applied to a series of uni-axial tensile tests (with E and lc to be identified) and to three-point bending tests (with E, lc and also Gc to be identified) on specimens made of ABS material. Results show that the optimal values of E and Gc are consistent in both tests, while lc presents a significant dependency upon the test type. Therefore, different values of the internal length scale should be identified and used to match the experimental responses under uni-axial tension or bending.","Tota, Rakesh Kumar;Paggi, Marco",58492108600;35148174600
10.1007/s00466-023-02314-x,0,"Soft materials are of major interest for biomechanics applications due to their high deformability and susceptibility to experience damage events under different loading scenarios. The present study is concerned with modelling damage evolution processes in these nonlinear materials whose structural responses are prone to locking when low-order kinematic interpolation is employed in the context of nonlinear Finite Element schemes. For this reason, a pair of gradient-enhanced continuum damage schemes are proposed with the aim of tackling mechanical failure problems in applications that exhibit shear and volumetric locking. In particular, we present the consistent formulation and the assessment of the corresponding performance of (i) a mixed displacement-enhanced assumed strain Q1Q1E24 employing a total Lagrangian formulation, and (ii) a three-field mixed displacement-pressure-Jacobian Q1Q1P0 formulation. The novel Q1Q1E24 and Q1Q1P0 formulations are consistently derived and numerically implemented, providing a satisfactory agreement with respect to ABAQUS built-in elements handling the treatment of shear and volumetric locking, respectively, in conjunction to the modelling damage phenomena via the use of a penalty-based gradient-enhanced formulation. This performance is examined via several numerical applications. Furthermore, the final example justifies the need for a formulation combining both mixed FE approaches to simulate problems encompassing both locking issues (shear and volumetric locking), which can be performed using a combination of the Q1Q1E24 and Q1Q1P0 herein proposed.","Valverde-González, A.;Reinoso, J.;Dortdivanlioglu, B.;Paggi, M.",57673055300;26644306500;56768082000;35148174600
10.1016/j.jmps.2023.105345,1,"Indentation tests are largely exploited in experiments to characterize the mechanical and fracture properties of the materials from the resulting crack patterns. This work proposes an efficient theoretical and computational framework, whose implementation is detailed for 2D axisymmetric and for 3D geometries, to simulate indentation-induced cracking phenomena caused by non-conforming contacts with indenter profiles of an arbitrary shape. The formulation hinges on the coupling of the MPJR (eMbedded Profile for Joint Roughness) interface finite elements which embed the indenter profile to efficiently solve the contact problem between non-planar bodies, and the phase-field model for brittle fracture to simulate crack evolution and nonlocal damage in the substrate. The novel framework is applied to predict cone-crack formation in the case of indentation tests with smooth spherical indenters, with validation against experimental data. Then, the methodology is employed for the very first time in the literature to assess the effect of surface roughness superimposed on the shape of the smooth spherical indenter. In terms of physical insights, numerical predictions quantify the dependencies of the critical load for crack nucleation and the crack radius on the amplitude of roughness in comparison with the behavior of smooth indenters. Again, the consistency with available experimental trends is noticed.","Marulli, M. R.;Bonari, J.;Reinoso, J.;Paggi, M.",57215922167;57201683724;26644306500;35148174600
10.1371/journal.pone.0289807,1,"The pursuit of a quantitative approach to functional analysis of stone tools is an ongoing endeavour for traceologists. Technological advancements in 3D imaging techniques, such as photogrammetry/3D scanners, CT scanning, 3D digital microscopy, confocal microscopy, AFM and FEG-SEM and micro-topographical scanning, have greatly facilitated the detailed capturing of the geometry and surface texture at multiple levels of observation, from the object-scale to the nano-scale. However, while such technological innovations have predominantly focused on flaked assemblages, ground stone tools have only recently begun to receive due attention, and a standardised protocol for their study is yet to be established. In order to comprehend the function(s) of these tools, analytical techniques that enable a 3D visualisation of the entire item and the wear affecting the used surfaces have proven to be of great support. To this end, an analytical procedure was developed and tested on slabs and pebbles in order to replicate the use-wear traces observed on Upper Palaeolithic tools. The purpose was to assemble a site-specific reference collection tailored on the artefacts from the cultural level III of the Brinzeni I cave in north-west Moldova. Experimental replicas were used to treat different plant organs during controlled sequential experiments. The present article reports on the analysis based on photogrammetric data acquired during two stages of replicative usage. We tested multiple acquisition setups and elaborations to assess the geometry modification and the surface depletion. By exploring various acquisition strategies, a critical evaluation of potential sources of bias in data collection and subsequent elaboration were performed, and the methodology was accordingly adjusted thereby enhancing the reliability and reproducibility of the results. This study highlights the importance of carefully considering the acquisition strategy in archaeological related research to ensure accurate analyses and to validate robust interpretation.","Sorrentino, Giusi;Menna, Fabio;Remondino, Fabio;Paggi, Marco;Longo, Laura;Borghi, Alessandro;Re, Alessandro;Giudice, Alessandro Lo",57222500375;35976590400;6507122674;35148174600;56219397300;7101872496;35231000200;7003419940
10.1002/nme.7233,0,"A comprehensive coupled thermo-chemo-mechanical modeling framework is proposed in this work to study the reaction-diffusion phenomena taking place inside photovoltaics (PV). When exposed to hygrothermal conditions, the encapsulant ethylene-co-vinyl acetate (EVA) layers undergo chemical degradation that significantly influences the overall PV performance. Aiming at efficient thermo-mechanical modeling, the coupled displacement-temperature governing equations for the EVA layers are formulated, and its 3D finite element (FE) implementation is derived in detail. Subsequently, the chemical reaction-diffusion processes occurring in the EVA layers are described, and the corresponding numerical implementation is formulated with the consideration of spatial and temporal variation of diffusivity and chemical kinetic rates. Specifically, the thermo-mechanical solution accounting for the heat generation from chemical reactions is projected to the FE model of the reaction-diffusion system in order to determine the kinetic rates and diffusion coefficients for its subsequent analysis. The proposed modeling method is applied to simulate the evolution of reaction-diffusion species at different damp heat tests, and predictions show a very satisfactory agreement with the analytical solution and experimental electroluminescence images taken from the literature. Its capabilities to predict the spatio-temporal variation are demonstrated through the simulation of the humidity freeze test, where the cyclic temperature boundary condition is imposed. With this modeling framework, it is possible to evaluate the degradation of PV modules under varying environmental boundary conditions, thus providing a guideline to design new products tailored for specific climatic zones.","Liu, Zeng;Lenarda, Pietro;Reinoso, Jose;Paggi, Marco",57368375800;57189370852;26644306500;35148174600

The purpose of this study is to build a reference collection for wear patterns that occurred during the processing of vegetal resources, specifically those compatible with the MIS 3 period. To create the collection, riverine slabs and pebbles were utilised and various aspects related to their use in the transformation of aerial and underground plant organs were explored. Moreover, the feasibility of using perishable supports, such as a wooden base, for processing tasks was examined. The experiments explored the transformation of pebble stone surfaces during repeated cycles of processing plant organs by monitoring and recording the features at fixed intervals. Several variables that affect the surface texture, morphology, distribution, and extent of use-wear traces are identified and discussed. The influential factors under control included the petrographic and morphological characteristics of the unused stones, the type and amount of transformed vegetables, and the duration of the process, as well as monitoring human factors. The documentation strategy applied at various stages of the experiment was found to be suitable for tracing the cumulative development of wear.

In this study, the fracture strength and the loss in electric power of Silicon-based solar cells are investigated considering the influence of crack size, orientation, type and temperature. Deep machine learning models are developed to estimate the fracture strength and the electric power of Silicon-based solar cells with initial cracks. The developed networks are trained with the help of data generated from molecular dynamics simulations. Therefore, molecular dynamics simulations are performed by considering initial edge/center cracks for ten different sizes, four different orientations, and operating at six different temperatures. Later on, results from molecular dynamics simulations are used to train and test the developed deep machine learning models. Results are validated by comparing them with the molecular dynamics simulation results, where a good agreement is observed. Thus, the proposed deep machine learning models can serve as tools to quickly estimate the fracture strength and electric power of Silicon-based solar cells containing initial cracks of arbitrary size, orientation, and operating temperatures.","Siruvuri, S.

10.1016/j.ijengsci.2023.103842,0,"Nowadays recycling of photovoltaics (PV) using the solvent method is becoming a very hot topic as massive products deployed in the last century have approached the end of their service lifetime. The key problem in the recycling of end-of-life PV modules is the nondestructive recovery of precious silicon wafers for the manufacturing of new products. However, the attempt to comprehensively understand the polymer–solvent system in the PV recycling process is completely lacking. In this work, a thermodynamically consistent large-deformation theory is proposed to model the coupled behavior of this system. The development of continuum theory accounts for the solvent permeation, swelling and elastic deformation, as well as shrinking effects due to the initial crosslinking of ethylene-co-vinyl acetate (EVA). The crosslinking of EVA influences the stiffness of the polymer network, and interacts with the diffusive kinetics of solvents. Also, given the effects of mechanical constraint, the two-way coupling between the EVA deformation and solvent diffusion is established on the basis of thermodynamic arguments. The proposed modeling method is firstly applied to simulate the swelling experiments of cylindrical EVA samples in solvents Toluene, Tetrahydrofuran, and Octane, and good agreement has been achieved between the numerical prediction and available testing data. Then the second example demonstrates the capability of this modeling framework to describe the influences of initial crosslinking and mechanical constraints on the time history evolution of swelling and elastic deformation. Finally, the complete PV laminate in the 3D setting is modeled for the investigation of solvent penetration induced deformation in the silicon cell layer during the PV recycling process, and comparison has been made to showcase the spatial distribution of maximum principal stress of the silicon cell layers in solvents with different solubility parameters and molar volumes.

10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2022.111798,7,"Fracture growth in a material is strongly influenced by the presence of inhomogeneities, which deviate crack trajectories from rectilinearity and deeply affect failure. Increasing crack tortuosity is connected to enhancement of fracture toughness, while often a crack may even be stopped when it impinges a void, which releases the stress concentration. Therefore, the determination of crack trajectories is important in the design against failure of materials and mechanical components. The recently developed phase-field approach (AT1 and AT2 models), based on a variational approach to damage localization, is believed to be particularly suited to describe complex crack trajectories. This belief is examined through a comparison between simulations and photoelastic experiments on PMMA plates, which have been designed in a new way, to highlight the effects of notches and circular holes on fracture propagation. The latter is shown to initiate from a notch and to be strongly attracted by voids. When a void is hit, fracture is arrested, unless the void contains a notch on its internal surface, from which a new crack nucleates and propagates. Different mechanical models are tested where fracture initiates and grows (i.) under Mode I compact tension, (ii.) four-point bending and (iii.) a tensile stress indirectly generated during compression of samples containing a circular hole. The experiments show that the fracture propagation may be ‘designed’ to develop in different tortuous paths, involving multiple arrests and secondary nucleation. Simulations performed with an ad hoc implemented version of the AT1 and AT2 phase-field methods (equipped with spectral decomposition, in which a crack is simulated as a highly localized zone of damage accumulation) are shown to be in close agreement with experiments and therefore confirm the validity of the approach and its potentialities for mechanical design.","Cavuoto, R.;Lenarda, P.;Misseroni, D.;Paggi, M.;Bigoni, D.",57189519041;57189370852;41661769100;35148174600;7003362024

Aiming at tackling the poor convergence performance of standard Newton schemes, a quasi-Newton (QN) scheme is proposed for the solution of coupled governing equations stemming from the enhanced assumed strain shell formulation in a monolithic manner. The excellent convergence performance of this QN monolithic scheme for the multi-field shell formulation is demonstrated through several paradigmatic boundary value problems, including single edge notched tension and shear, fracture of cylindrical structure under mixed loading and fatigue induced crack growth. Compared with the popular alternating minimization (AM) or staggered solution scheme, it is also found that the QN monolithic solution scheme for the phase field modeling using enhanced strain shell formulation is very efficient without the loss of robustness, and significant computational gains are observed in all the numerical examples. In addition, to further reduce the computational cost in fracture modeling of large-scale thin-walled structures, a specific global–local phase field approach for solid shell elements in the 3D setting is proposed, in which the full displacement-phase field problem is considered at the local level, while addressing only the elastic problem at the global level. Its capability is demonstrated by the modeling of a cylindrical structure subjected to both static and fatigue cyclic loading conditions, which can be appealing to industrial applications.","Liu, Z.;Reinoso, J.;Paggi, M.",57368375800;26644306500;35148174600

Cracks grow during real-time operation and also new cracks will be formed, leading to further charge accumulation. In this study, the influence of cracks on the movement of charges and hence the current-voltage characteristics of silicon based solar cells is investigated through molecular dynamics simulations. Simulations are performed considering a domain of dimensions 260.64 Å × 222.63 Å × 43.44 Å with five different cases: (1) without any initial defects, (2) an edge crack, (3) a center crack, (4) two angled edge cracks and (5) two oblique cracks from a circular crack at the center of the domain, considering a time step of 1 fs. Charges of the atoms at a given time instant are estimated after charge equilibration. The electric current, voltage, and power are estimated based on the charges. As the crack starts propagating, the charge fluctuations of a group of atoms around the crack tip are observed to be in the range of -9 × 103e to -6 × 10-3e, where the highest fluctuation is noticed in case of angled edge cracks. The electric current for the same atoms is found to be fluctuating between -0.02 nA and -0.098 nA, peak fluctuations observed in the case of the edge crack. Similar ranges of charge and current without any initial crack are found to be: 0 × 10-3 e and 3 × 10-3 e, and 0 nA and 0.01 nA, respectively. This confirms that the presence of cracks can hinder the charge flow. Furthermore, the peak voltage estimated between two groups of charges: near and far away from the crack tip is found to be 1.24 × 10-22 V. Whereas, the peak voltage between two groups considered away from the crack tip is equal to 0.1 × 10-22 V, indicating that the potential difference is significant due to charge accumulation around the damaged areas. Moreover, the electric power associated with the group of atoms around the crack tip is observed to be fluctuating rapidly. The peak electrical power of the intact cell is estimated to be 2.14 nW, whereas it is dropped down to 31.93% in the presence of two inclined edge cracks.

In this study, the mechanics of nacre-like brick-mortar structures is investigated through numerical simulations. The shear stress distribution in the matrix of nacreous composites is found to be non-homogeneous primarily due to: (i) elastic properties mismatch between brick and mortar and (ii) the periodic microstructure. This non-homogeneous stress distribution is successfully reduced by grading the elastic modulus of the matrix material so as to considerably enhance the performance of the nacreous composite. A framework has been developed here to design nacre-inspired composites incorporating a functionally modulus graded interphase material. The different parameters influencing the non-uniform stress distribution, such as: interphase thickness, elastic modulus and overlap length are studied, elucidating how such parameters can be effectively controlled to reduce the non-homogeneous stress distribution and reduce the peak stresses. The peak stresses in the interphase are observed to exponentially increase up to 100%, when overlap length is 10% of the brick length. The strength and peak stresses in the interphase are observed to be higher for thin interphases, where a 50% decrease in thickness resulted in a 40% increase in the peak shear stress, and an 80% reduction yielded 150% increase. On the other hand, the elastic modulus is observed to scale with the strength, for instance, when the modulus is increased by 20% and 50%, the increase in peak shear stresses in the interphase are observed to be 10% and 22%, respectively. Furthermore, the shear stresses in the interphase are made uniform by varying the parameters such as: interphase thickness, elastic modulus and overlap length.

A possible bias in the data induced by the extent in the use of medical swabs is found in relation to Valle d’Aosta and Veneto. Observed data are then interpreted using a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) epidemiological model enhanced with asymptomatic (infected and recovered) compartments, including lockdown effects through time-dependent model parameters. The initial number of susceptible individuals for each region is also considered as a parameter to be identified. The issue of parameters identification is herein addressed by a robust machine learning approach based on particle swarm optimization. Model predictions provide relevant information for policymakers in terms of the effect of lockdown measures in the different regions. The number of susceptible individuals involved in the epidemic, important for a safe release of lockdown during the next phases, is predicted to be around 10% of the population for Lombardy, 16% for Reggio Emilia, 18% for Veneto, and 40% for Valle d’Aosta.","Paggi, Marco",35148174600
10.1016/j.tafmec.2020.102621,21,"Transverse intralaminar cracks in layers with perpendicular orientation referred to the main loading direction have a significant effect on the apparent ultimate strength of the corresponding composite laminate. This effect stems from the fact that such transverse cracks generally promote the occurrence of other failure mechanisms leading to the specimen collapse in subsequent stages of the loading process. With the aim of conducting a careful investigation regarding the onset and progression of transverse intralaminar cracking events, a micro-mechanical analysis of cross-ply laminates is herein proposed. Particularly, the cross-ply laminates belonging to the family [0°2/90°n/0°2] are considered via the generation of high-fidelity micro-mechanical models, which reproduce the internal fiber arrangements related to the reference results in Saito et al. 2012, Experimental evaluation of the damage growth restraining in 90° layer of thin-ply CFRP cross ply laminates, Adv. Comp Mat, 21:1,57–66. Differing from alternative approaches, current predictions are equipped with the combined used of two fracture-based modeling methods: (i) the variational phase field (PF) approach for triggering crack events into the matrix, and (ii) the bilinear cohesive zone model (CZM) for the simulation of fibre-matrix decohesion failures. Relying on this computational methodology, the focus of this work is to analyze the influence of the transverse ply thickness (n) on the onset and propagation of damage under tensile conditions, in conjunction with the transition from micro-cracking to meso-scale damage states. For this purpose, several models are generated into the FE package ABAQUS using user-defined capabilities, replicating configurations of specimens included in previous experimental investigations, i.e. through the consideration of different transverse ply thickness (n = 1, 2, 4). Present results show the potential of the proposed methodology to predict the transverse matrix cracking phenomena and the ability and reliability for capturing the delay of the crack with thinner plies, a phenomenon which is usually denominated as in-situ effect in the related literature.","Guillén-Hernández, T.;Quintana-Corominas, A.;García, I.

The formulation considers different assumptions on the evolution of damage at the microscale (e.g., damage in the matrix and not in the inclusion/fiber), as well as the role played by the microstructural reinforcement, i.e. its volumetric content and shape. Numerical results show that the proposed formulation leads to an apparent tensile strength and a post-peak branch of unnotched and notched specimens dependent not only on the internal length scale of the phase field approach, as for homogeneous materials, but also on microstructural features.

This evidence could be exploited as a technical solution for a new type of crack arrester, with a negligible impact on the global stiffness, strength and weight of the structure. In order to exploit this concept, an experimental campaign based on photo-elasticity and digital image correlation (DIC) is carried out, showing the capability of curved weak interfaces to arrest cracks. The experiment is repeated for several geometrical configurations through the modification of the interface curvature radii. The phenomenon of crack deviation and subsequent arrest at the interface is also investigated by a computational model based on the finite element method. The computational predictions provide the rationale for the interpretation of the experimental observations, and distinguish between the different behaviours of concave and convex interfaces.

To evaluate the effect of external (temperature, humidity) and internal (manufacturing defects) causes of blistering, we propose a semi-analytic model to describe this phenomenon in poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate)-based modules. The blistering occurrence is triggered by pressure exerted by partially vaporized moisture in existing defects. Vapor pressure in such defects, originated during module manufacturing, is related to moisture concentration profiles, governed by external conditions. Moisture also affects the adhesive fracture energy which plays a fundamental role in blistering activation. The proposed model predicts the critical pressure and the critical size of the initial defects causing blistering. This work represents an important step for the long-term reliability prediction of photovoltaic modules.","Gagliardi, M.;Paggi, M.",57213336597;35148174600

As a result, these materials can experience intricate fracture patterns endowing various cracking phenomena such as: Branching, coalescence, shielding, and amplification, among many others. In this article, we present a numerical investigation concerning the applicability of an original bulk-interface fracture simulation technique to trigger such phenomena within the context of the phase field approach for fracture. In particular, the prediction of failure patterns in heterogenous rock masses with brittle response is accomplished through the current methodology by combining the phase field approach for intact rock failure and the cohesive interface-like modeling approach for its application in joint fracture. Predictions from the present technique are first validated against Brazilian test results, which were developed using alternative phase field methods, and with respect to specimens subjected to different loading case and whose corresponding definitions are characterized by the presence of single and multiple flaws. Subsequently, the numerical study is extended to the analysis of heterogeneous rock masses including joints that separate different potential lithologies, leading to tortuous crack paths, which are observed in many practical situations.","Reinoso, José;Durand, Percy;Budarapu, Pattabhi Ramaiah;Paggi, Marco",26644306500;7202230035;55938567600;35148174600

To this aim, the phase field model for fracture is exploited to simulate the crack pattern leading to debris formation in the asperity junction model. Based on dimensional analysis considerations, the effect of the size of the junction length, the lateral size of the asperity, and the amplitude of the re-entrant corner angles γ and β defined by the junction geometry is examined in the parametric analysis. Results show that two failure modes are expected to occur, one with a crack nucleated at the re-entrant corner γ, and another with a crack nucleated at the re-entrant corner β, depending on the dominant power of the stress-singularity at the two re-entrant corner tips. Steady-state adhesive wear, where the initial asperity junction geometry is reproduced after debris formation, is observed for asperity junctions with γ= 45 ∘, almost independently of the lateral size of the asperity and of the horizontal projection of the junction length.","Carollo, Valerio;Paggi, Marco;Reinoso, José",57170434500;35148174600;26644306500

To pin-point the influence of graphene, fracture properties estimated from molecular dynamics simulations of three different cases in uniaxial tension are compared. In the first case, the fracture properties of silicon alone are estimated in relation to different initial defect sizes. Second, the same simulations are repeated by depositing graphene on the silicon surface. Atomic interactions in the composite structure are modeled using the combined adaptive inter-molecular reactive empirical bond order (AIREBO) and Tersoff potential functions. Improvement of about 780% in the Young's modulus of silicon is achieved after coating with graphene.

Three different types of epoxy-based composites laminates fabricated by vacuum bagging technique containing unidirectional (UD) flax, hybrid carbon-flax and carbon fibre-reinforced composite were used. The drilling parameters used were traverse speeds of 20, 40, 60 and 80 mm/min, constant water jet pressure of 300 MPa and a hole diameter of 10 mm. The results obtained depict that the traverse speed had a significant effect with respect to both surface roughness and delamination drilling-induced damage responses. Evidently, an increase in water jet traverse speed caused an increase in both damage responses of the three samples. Significantly, the CFRP composite sample recorded the lowest surface roughness damage response, followed by C-FFRP, while FFRP exhibited the highest. However, samples of FFRP and hybrid C-FFRP recorded lowest and highest delamination damage responses, respectively. The discrepancy in both damage responses, as further validated with micrographs of colour video microscopy (CVM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray micro-computed tomography (X-ray μCT), is attributed to the different mechanical properties of the reinforced fibres, fibre orientation/ply stacking and hybridisation of the samples.","Dhakal, Hom Nath;Ismail, Sikiru Oluwarotimi;Ojo, Saheed Olalekan;Paggi, Marco;Smith, James R.",9638750800;56828817600;57191160425;35148174600;57207399126

Different strategies are required to adequately obtain the reduced solutions of different classes of molecular dynamics systems. In this work, a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is combined with the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) to study atomic systems. Due to the limitations of the DEIM in capturing the nonlocal response of the nonlinear force field of MD systems, a nonlocal adaptive discrete empirical interpolation method (ADEIM) is proposed. Furthermore, a modified hp-refinement algorithm is introduced to extend the application of the POD-DEIM approach to order reduction of multi-dimensional MD systems. In the DEIM, the distance between atoms and hence the reduced internal force vector is estimated based on a local interpolation of the state variables. The internal forces of a multi-dimensional MD system depend on the distance between the atoms, represented in space by more than one coordinate. Therefore, the ADEIM approach seeks to obtain a nonlocal interpolation of the state variables to accurately predict the distance between the interpolated atoms and hence the reduced force vector. Simulation of MD systems with frequently changing neighbour atoms leads to change in the system dynamics, which further leads to change of properties of the snapshots. Therefore, the temporal domain is adaptively subdivided into smaller sub-domains using the adopted hp-refinement procedure. The reduced system parameters are effectively derived over the sub-domains.

This paper presents the application of two recent modeling methods for the failure analysis and strength prediction of open-hole thin ply laminates under tensile loading, which exhibit a brittle response upon failure: (i) the analytical coupled energy-stress Finite Fracture Mechanics (FFMs) technique, and (ii) the FE-based Phase Field (PF) approach for fracture that is incorporated into an enhanced assumed solid shell element.

10.1016/j.compositesb.2017.05.039,48,"Fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composite laminates are employed in many industrial applications due to their attractive mechanical and structural properties. Machining operation, such as drilling of FRP laminates, plays a significant role in the assembly of parts in aircraft and spacecraft production. Among other production bottlenecks, drilling-induced delamination remains a major defect which adversely affects the quality of assembly parts. An efficient strategy in preventing this problem is the calculation of the critical thrust force above which delamination is initiated. Therefore, in this study, a new analytical model is proposed to predict the critical thrust force for delamination. Unlike the general models in the literature which derived only mode I strain energy release rate based on the assumption of classical laminate plate theory (CLPT) combined with linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) mode I considerations in the elliptic delamination zone, the proposed analytical model is derived based on first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) and accounts for mode I and mode II strain energy release rates in the delamination zone. This strategy allows to activate mixed mode criteria for delamination initiation which is a valid assumption for laminates with layers of different orientations. The present model is partly derived for general laminates subject to distributed loading and further extended to cross-ply laminate sequence subject to a mixed load condition. The results show that the effect of shear deformation in the prediction of the critical thrust force is influential with increasing ply thickness and the effect of chisel edge on shear deformation is more profound in the distributed load regime.","Ojo, Saheed Olalekan;Ismail, Sikiru Oluwarotimi;Paggi, Marco;Dhakal, Hom Nath",57191160425;56828817600;35148174600;9638750800

The effect of the microstructural heterogeneity is taken into account by means of periodic perturbation functions, which derive from the solution of nonhomogeneous recursive cell problems defined over the unit periodic cell. A strong coupling is present between the microdisplacement field and the microelectric potential field, since the mechanical and the electric problems are fully coupled in the asymptotically expanded microscale field equations. The microdisplacement, the electric potential, and the relative temperature fields have been related to the macroscopic quantities and to their gradients in the derived down-scaling relations. Average field equations of infinite order have been obtained and the closed form of the overall constitutive tensors has been determined for the equivalent first-order homogenized continuum. A formal solution of such equations has been derived by means of an asymptotic expansion of the macrofields. The accuracy of the proposed formulation is assessed in relation to illustrative examples of a bi-material periodic microstructure subjected to harmonic body forces, free charge densities, and heat sources, whose periodicity is much greater than the characteristic microstructural size.

In the current investigation, this problem is revisited in view of the recent progresses on the phase field approach of brittle fracture. In this concern, a novel formulation combining the phase field approach for modeling brittle fracture in the bulk and a cohesive zone model for pre-existing adhesive interfaces is herein proposed to investigate the competition between crack penetration and deflection at an interface. The model, implemented within the finite element method framework using a monolithic fully implicit solution strategy, is applied to provide a further insight into the understanding of the role of model parameters on the above competition. In particular, in this study, the role of the fracture toughness ratio between the interface and the adjoining bulks and of the characteristic fracture-length scales of the dissipative models is analyzed. In the case of a brittle interface, the asymptotic predictions based on linear elastic fracture mechanics criteria for crack penetration, single deflection or double deflection are fully captured by the present method. Moreover, by increasing the size of the process zone along the interface, or by varying the internal length scale of the phase field model, new complex phenomena are emerging, such as simultaneous crack penetration and deflection and the transition from single crack penetration to deflection and penetration with subsequent branching into the bulk. The obtained computational trends are in very good agreement with previous experimental observations and the theoretical considerations on the competition and interplay between both fracture mechanics models open new research perspectives for the simulation and understanding of complex fracture patterns.","Paggi, M.;Reinoso, J.",35148174600;26644306500

A hybrid solid shell formulation relying on the combined use of the enhanced assumed strain (EAS) and the assumed natural strain (ANS) methods has been considered to efficiently model the material in thin structures at the continuum level. The phantom node method (PNM) is employed to model the discontinuities in the bulk. The discontinuous solid shell element is then concurrently coupled with a molecular statics model placed around the crack tip. The coupling between the coarse scale and the fine scale is realized through the use of ghost atoms, whose positions are interpolated from the coarse scale solution and enforced as boundary conditions to the fine scale model. In the proposed numerical scheme, the fine scale region is adaptively enlarged as the crack propagates and the region behind the crack tip is adaptively coarsened in order to reduce the computation costs. An energy criterion is used to detect the crack tip location. All the atomistic simulations are carried out using the LAMMPS software. A computational framework has been developed in MATLAB to trigger LAMMPS through system command. This allows a two way interaction between the coarse and fine scales in MATLAB platform, where the boundary conditions to the fine region are extracted from the coarse scale, and the crack tip location from the atomistic model is transferred back to the continuum scale. The developed framework has been applied to study crack growth in the energy minimization problems. Inspired by the influence of fracture on current–voltage characteristics of thin Silicon photovoltaic cells, the cubic diamond lattice structure of Silicon is used to model the material in the fine scale region, whilst the Tersoff potential function is employed to model the atom–atom interactions.

Spatially uniform and non-uniform temperature distributions are compared to accurately assess the amount of the residual compressive stresses raised in the Silicon cells after lamination. The use of more realistic non-uniform temperature distributions leads to lower residual compressive stresses in Silicon as compared to the uniform case.,"Ojo, S. O.;Paggi, M.",56950377100;35148174600

The additional thermal resistance of micro-cracks due to imperfect bonding is estimated according to an analogy with a contact mechanics formulation, where the dependency on the crack opening is suitably accounted for. A numerical example shows the applicability of the proposed approach to practical problems. © 2013 The Authors.","Paggi, Marco;Sapora, Alberto",35148174600;24281957600
10.1016/j.compstruc.2013.03.006,7,"In this article, the problem of cracking in concrete gravity dams subjected to seismic loadings is examined under a multiscale perspective. Preliminarily, the size-scale effects on the mechanical parameters entering the nonlinear constitutive models of the interface crack are discussed. From a wide review of existing experimental results, it is shown that the material tensile strength, the fracture energy, the friction coefficient and the concrete compressive strength are strongly size-scale dependent. This evidence pinpoints the necessity of performing experimental testing on large scale specimens to assess the value of the parameters to be used in nonlinear fracture mechanics simulations. Moreover, the size-scale dependency of the interface constitutive properties implies the necessity of updating their values during crack propagation simulations. To do so, interface properties are not given in input a priori, but they are selected at each step of the simulation according to the specified scaling laws. The numerical simulations, based on the finite element method and a generalized interface constitutive law for contact and decohesion implemented in the node-to-segment contact strategy, show the high sensitivity of the phenomenon of crack propagation by the parameters of the damage law used to degrade the cohesive zone properties in case of repeated cycles. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Taking into account the effect of geometric nonlinearity in the equations of motion through the geometric stiffness matrix, the problem is reduced to a generalized eigenproblem where both the loading multiplier and the natural frequency of the system are unknown. According to this approach, all of the forms of instabilities intermediate between those of pure buckling and pure forced resonance can be investigated. Numerous examples are analyzed, including discrete mechanical systems with one to n degrees of freedom, continuous mechanical systems, such as oscillating deflected beams subjected to a compressive axial load, as well as oscillating beams subjected to lateral-torsional buckling. A general finite element procedure is also outlined, with the possibility to apply the proposed approach to any general bi- or tri-dimensional framed structure.

10.1007/978-3-642-33968-4_5,3,"In the present paper, two size-effect laws for the friction coefficient of rough surfaces are proposed and compared. The former is based on purely dimensional analysis arguments and is related to the fractality of the contact domains. This scaling law applies from the macro to the planetary scales, where contact is almost elastic. The latter, holding at the micro and nanoscales, is based on the adhesion theory of friction and assumes that the friction resistance is governed by the strong adhesive bonds at the asperities, caused by elasto-plastic deformations. Whereas the fractal scaling law suggests a friction coefficient decreasing with the size of the nominal contact area, the opposite trend is predicted by the adhesion theory. The application of these two scaling laws to Zircalloy (Zr-4), Stainless Steel (SS304) and Nickel (Ni200) permits to determine the scale range of validity of each scaling law and to show that they may coexist.

10.1016/j.jmps.2012.01.009,53,"In this study we investigate the effect of imperfect (not perfectly bonded) interfaces on the stiffness and strength of hierarchical polycrystalline materials. As a case study we consider a honeycomb cellular polycrystal used for drilling and cutting tools. The conclusions of the analysis are, however, general and applicable to any material with structural hierarchy. Regarding the stiffness, generalized expressions for the Voigt and Reuss estimates of the bounds to the effective elastic modulus of heterogeneous materials are derived. The generalizations regard two aspects that are not included in the standard Reuss and Voigt estimates. The first novelty consists in considering finite thickness interfaces between the constituents undergoing damage up to final debonding. The second generalization consists of interfaces not perpendicular or parallel to the loading direction, i.e., when isostress or isostrain conditions are not satisfied. In this case, approximate expressions for the effective elastic modulus are obtained by performing a computational homogenization approach. In the second part of the paper, the homogenized response of a representative volume element (RVE) of the honeycomb cellular polycrystalline material with one or two levels of hierarchy is numerically investigated. This is put forward by using the cohesive zone model (CZM) for finite thickness interfaces recently proposed by the authors and implemented in the finite element program FEAP. From tensile tests we find that the interface nonlinearity significantly contributes to the deformability of the material. Increasing the number of hierarchical levels, the deformability increases. The RVE is tested in two different directions and, due to different orientations of the interfaces and Mixed Mode deformation, anisotropy in stiffness and strength is observed. Stiffness anisotropy is amplified by increasing the number of hierarchical levels. Finally, the interaction between interfaces at different hierarchical levels is numerically characterized. A condition for scale separation, which corresponds to the independence of the material tensile strength from the properties of the interfaces in the second level, is established. When this condition is fulfilled, the material microstructure at the second level can be efficiently replaced by an effective homogeneous continuum with a homogenized stressstrain response. From the engineering point of view, the proposed criterion of scale separation suggests how to design the optimal microstructure of a hierarchical level to maximize the material tensile strength.

They include the FE implementation of the proposed nonlocal CZM in the framework of zero-thickness interface elements and the numerical treatment of the related nonlocality. In particular, a Newton-Raphson method, combined with a series expansion to obtain tentative values for the cohesive tractions, is used to efficiently compute the tangent stiffness matrix and the residual vector of the interface elements. Then, numerical applications to polycrystalline materials are proposed, focusing on the constitutive modelling of the finite thickness interfaces between the grains. It will be shown that the parameters of the nonlocal CZM (shape, peak stress, fracture energy) depend on the thickness of the interface. The CZM is able to produce statistical distributions of Mode I fracture energies consistent with those assumed a priori in stochastic fracture mechanics studies. The statistical variability of fracture parameters, originating from the natural variability of the interface thicknesses, has an important influence on the crack patterns observed from simulated tensile tests. Finally, we show that the relation between interface thickness and grain size can be used to explain the grain-size effects on the material tensile strength. In particular, considering a sublinear relation between the interface thickness and the grain diameter at the microscale, the nonlocal CZM is able to recover the Hall-Petch law. Therefore, the proposed model suggests that an inverse relation between the interface thickness and the grain size would lead to an inversion of the Hall-Petch law as well.

In this paper, an asymptotic analysis of the electromagnetic fields at multi-material wedges composed of metamaterials is proposed. This is made possible by removing the assumption of positive electric permittivities and magnetic permeabilities, an hypothesis which usually applies to conventional materials. Exploring the whole range of variability of these electromagnetic properties, it is shown that, in addition to the classical real eigenvalues 0 ≤ λ < 1 leading to power-law singularities of the type O(r λ-1) as r → 0, it is also possible to find imaginary eigenvalues leading to hypersingular solutions, as well as nonsingular configurations for a suitable choice of the negative electric permittivities and magnetic permeabilities of the media. Moreover, to fully characterize the asymptotic fields, the analysis is not only restricted to the determination of the lowest real and complex eigenvalues, but is also extended to the evaluation of the higher-order nonsingular ones.

In particular, that provided by Persson's theory, and that obtained from the Bush, Gibson and Thomas (BGT-A) asperity contact theory, which is a generalized form of the Greenwood and Williamson (GW) one. The two theories differ only by a numerical constant κ = sqrt(8 / π) ≈ 1.6 vs κ = sqrt(2 π) ≈ 2.5, but neither of the two provide an accurate prediction, Persson's value being generally too low, and BGT-A's limit being only valid for extremely large separations. A detailed numerical comparison using a range of generated fractal surfaces permits to compare the existing models, finding for example that bandwidth is more important than Gaussianity of the surfaces. Then, we propose two new theoretical equations generalizing GW and BGT to take into account interaction effects in an approximate way (GW-I and BGT-I, respectively), which significantly improve the accuracy of original asperity models. Further, as a practical alternative to the tribologist, we suggest a new very simple discrete form of the GW model (called GW-RI) whose accuracy is similar to BGT-I, but with much lower computational cost, comparable to analytical solutions since the latter require the evaluation of the variance of the profile slopes, σm2, with a surface defined at a given set of points.

This is achieved by modeling the nonlinear interface behavior according to a cohesive law accounting for Mode Mixity. The numerically obtained load versus midspan deflection curves for three- or four-point bending beams show that the process of end-plate debonding is the result of a snap-back instability, which is fully interpreted in the framework of the Catastrophe Theory.

10.1016/j.wear.2008.01.019,186,"Recent direct implementation of asperity theories is reinterpreted here to formulate an improved version of the Greenwood and Williamson (GW) theory with the inclusion of interaction between asperities. This is achieved by treating the contact pressures as uniformly distributed over the apparent contact area and the resulting deformation as uniform. The correction is equivalent to an increase of the effective separation of the mean planes by a quantity proportional to the nominal pressure, resulting in a reduction of the ""real"" area of contact and of total load for a given separation. However, the area-load relationship is unchanged. The correction effectively depends on the ratio between the nominal pressure and the elastic modulus multiplied by the ratio between the size of the nominal contact area and standard deviation of the asperity heights. For contacts much larger than the size of roughness, uniform interaction effects would be dominant at relatively modest pressures (particularly for soft materials). This also means that the effect of interaction is unlimited. However, the only significant change is in the prediction of gas-tightness, it is harder to seal a large area than a small one. The modification of the theory has a significant effect on stiffness and conductance. Indeed, a parallel is drawn between this correction and the ""clustering"" terms of resistance in the Holm-Greenwood formulae for a cluster of circular spots. Finally, numerical contact simulations using Weierstrass-Mandelbrot (WM) surfaces show a general agreement with the improved theory but also significant scatter for low load levels. Taking into account the effect of asperity interaction, the improved GW theory is now able to predict the numerically obtained contact response for intermediate load levels. © 2008.","Ciavarella, M.;Greenwood, J.

From such a retrospective analysis, it emerges that the problem of contact between the platens of the testing machine and the concrete specimen plays a crucial role for the explanation of the variability of the concrete compressive strength as a function of specimen shape. To obtain quantitative predictions and to investigate on the influence of the friction coefficient, uniaxial compressive tests are numerically simulated by using a nonlinear finite element model. Both the constitutive nonlinearity of concrete and the nonlinearity due to contact are taken into account in the formulation. The results of the proposed parametric analysis permit to evaluate the evolution of the conversion ratio between cylinder and cube strength as a function of the friction coefficient. This sheds a new light on the complex nature of this nonlinear relationship, whose value approaches 1 for a friction coefficient close to 0.01, simulating the presence of Teflon, and then approaches asymptotically 0.78 for f = 0.60, as is typical of steel-concrete interfaces. © 2007 RILEM has copyright.","Indelicato, Ferdinando;Paggi, Marco",6603544387;35148174600

Due to the difference in the elastic properties of the constituent materials, the junction points can be the origin of stress singularities and a possible source of damage. Hence, a full appreciation of these critical situations is of fundamental importance both from the mathematical and the engineering standpoints. In this paper, an overview of interface mechanical problems leading to stress singularities is proposed to show their relevance in engineering. The mathematical methods for the asymptotic analysis of stress singularities in multimaterial junctions and wedges composed of isotropic linear-elastic materials are reviewed and compared, with special attention to in-plane and out-of-plane loadings. This analysis mathematically demonstrates in a historical retrospective the equivalence of the eigenfunction expansion method, of the complex function representation, and of the Mellin transform technique for the determination of the order of the stress singularity in such problems. The analogies between linear elasticity and the Stokes flow of dissimilar immiscible fluids, the steady-state heat transfer across different materials, and the St. Venant torsion of composite bars are also discussed. Finally, advanced issues for the stress singularities due to joining of angularly nonhomogeneous elastic wedges are presented. This review article contains 147 references.

The paper deals with the analysis of the influence of nonuniform bonding properties or interfacial defects on the crack propagation process and its stability. To this aim, the classical analytical approach based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam on an elastic foundation is extended to the presence of a general distribution of microcracks ahead of the macrocrack tip. The main features and limitations of this approach are carefully analyzed. In particular, it is shown that this simplified approach does not consider the unilateral contact condition along the interface, thus admitting a penetration between the two arms of the beam. A comparison with a finite element formulation is proposed to assess if this violation of the constraints inequalities, usually adopted in the case of uniform bonding, is still acceptable when interfacial defects are present. In order to fully describe the whole nonlinear behavior of the interface, a generalized interface constitutive law is used.

Hence, the resolution dependence of the statistical parameters computed according to the random process theory, of the plasticity index and of the contact predictions provided by stochastic and fractal contact models is discussed and emphasized. It is demonstrated that the plasticity index diverges to infinity when the lower cut-off length of the system vanishes, whereas the slope of the real contact area versus normal load curve tends to zero. In this limit case stochastic and fractal approaches predict either a vanishing real contact area or an infinite normal pressure, regardless of the asperity deformation assumptions.

To deal with this problem several micromechanical contact models have been developed since the middle of the 19th Century. Such models are based on very different mathematical frameworks, with a consequent lack of standardization. The recent perspective to apply such models to smaller and smaller scale lengths, down to the nanoscale, makes the reliability of these models a still open issue.

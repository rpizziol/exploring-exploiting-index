10.1038/s41598-023-34024-y,4,"To achieve sustainable development worldwide, the United Nations set 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for humanity to reach by 2030. Society is involved in the challenge, with firms playing a crucial role. Thus, a key question is to what extent firms engage with the SDGs. Efforts to map firms’ contributions have mainly focused on analysing companies’ reports based on limited samples and non-real-time data. We present a novel interdisciplinary approach based on analysing big data from an online social network (Twitter) with complex network methods from statistical physics. By doing so, we provide a comprehensive and nearly real-time picture of firms’ engagement with SDGs. Results show that: (1) SDGs themes tie conversations among major UK firms together; (2) the social dimension is predominant; (3) the attention to different SDGs themes varies depending on the community and sector firms belong to; (4) stakeholder engagement is higher on posts related to global challenges compared to general ones; (5) large UK companies and stakeholders generally behave differently from Italian ones. This paper provides theoretical contributions and practical implications relevant to firms, policymakers and management education. Most importantly, it provides a novel tool and a set of keywords to monitor the influence of the private sector on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.","Patuelli, Alessia;Saracco, Fabio",57063166100;36344077800
10.1007/s10551-021-04930-0,15,"This study explores the downsizing propensity of family and non-family firms by considering their territorial embeddedness during both periods of economic stability and financial crisis. By drawing on a panel dataset of Spanish manufacturing firms for the period 2002–2015, we show that, all things being equal, family firms have a lower propensity to downsizing than non-family firms. When considering the effect of territorial embeddedness, we found that territorially embedded family firms have an even lower propensity to downsizing than their non-family counterparts. Furthermore, the concern of territorially embedded family firms for their employees’ welfare was particularly pronounced during the years of the global financial crisis. This result is explained by the existence of socially proximate relationships with the firms’ immediate surroundings, based on similarity and a sense of belonging, which push deeply rooted family firms to treat their employees as salient stakeholders during hard times. Overall, our study stresses the importance of local roots in moderating the relationship between family firms and downsizing.","Amato, Stefano;Patuelli, Alessia;Basco, Rodrigo;Lattanzi, Nicola",57216126995;57063166100;35791628900;56136055200

10.1007/978-3-031-31793-4_8,0,"Family business research has mainly focused on explaining how the interaction between two domains, namely the family and the business, shapes a firm’s behavior and outcomes, thus making family firms unique. More recently, a new stream of research investigating the interplay between family firms and geographical space has unfolded, disclosing new facets of the family business phenomenon. Exploring the “family firm-territory nexus” means understanding the distinctive way these businesses are affected by and able to influence the geographical space where the firm’s economic activity and the family’s social life both take place. This nexus is such that the peculiarities of the family firm enmesh with the peculiarities of a given territory. This book took part in this debate by untangling the micro-territorial foundations of family firms. Specifically, the main research questions this book addressed revolved around what makes families deeply “anchored” or embedded in their home territory and the influence of local ties on family firms’ economic performance and corporate social responsibility.","Amato, Stefano;Patuelli, Alessia",57216126995;57063166100
10.1007/978-3-031-31793-4_4,0,"This chapter explores the firm–territory “nexus,” by disentangling the concept of the firm’s local embeddedness. After retracing the evolution of the concept, its formulation in spatial terms, and the dark side of embeddedness, the chapter sheds light on the entrepreneur’s place attachment underlying the firm’s embeddedness in the local context. Then, it delves deeply into the family firms. By untangling the peculiar place attachment of the owning family, the chapter depicts the local roots embedding the firm in a given locality and the influence on firms’ outcomes. The manuscript ends by analyzing the factors either embedding or disembedding family firms from their home territory and the adverse effects of over-embeddedness.","Amato, Stefano;Patuelli, Alessia",57216126995;57063166100

After that, the chapter describes agglomeration economies as a source of firm and territorial competitiveness. Then, it disentangles the proximity dimensions affecting innovation. After describing the most explored agglomerated areas, that is, industrial districts and business clusters, the chapter concludes by exploring the role of SMEs in peripheral areas.","Amato, Stefano;Patuelli, Alessia",57216126995;57063166100
10.1007/978-3-031-31793-4_1,0,"In the last two decades, there has been a growing interest in family firms as a particular type of business where a family, a social unit sharing legal or genetic bonds, influences the organization’s goals, strategy, and processes. The provision of the means, both material and immaterial, to satisfy the primary needs of its members entails the conduct of the economic activity, that is, a set of actions consisting in the production, sale, and distribution of goods and services, and which is instrumental in this respect. Thus, the firm becomes a conventional organizational device through which the family carries out such an economic activity and, by combining production factors, becomes involved in business or, put differently, becomes an “entrepreneur.”","Amato, Stefano;Patuelli, Alessia",57216126995;57063166100
10.1007/978-3-031-31793-4_5,0,The chapter aims to contextualize the current debate on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in family firms: most academic research maintains that family firms are more committed to socially and environmentally responsible activities and communicate more on CSR than non-family firms. The chapter introduces the concept of CSR and state-of-the-art CSR in family firms. It then explores the role of family firms as place-based enterprises fostering environmental and social responsibility in local communities.,"Amato, Stefano;Patuelli, Alessia",57216126995;57063166100

After depicting the family firm phenomenon in Italy, the chapter describes the data and variables employed in the analysis and the descriptive statistics. Specifically, two empirical studies are carried out. The first investigates the moderating effect of local roots and geographic isolation on family firms’ productivity. The second explores the voluntary adoption of the ISO 14 001 certificates and the influence of local roots in prompting the pro-environmental attitudes of family and non-family firms.","Amato, Stefano;Patuelli, Alessia",57216126995;57063166100

Based on a field visit, in-depth interviews, and document analysis, the case shows how the family firm plays a central role in developing and maintaining the individuals’ and family’s relationships with the territory. It also shows how a territorially embedded family firm transforms its relationship with the place into a more significant concern for environmental issues, defending the territory under challenging times.","Amato, Stefano;Patuelli, Alessia",57216126995;57063166100

After an excursus on the primary literature which defines a family firm, the chapter introduces the definitional dilemma and the concept of heterogeneity. The chapter proceeds with an overview of the primary theoretical constructs that help to understand family firms’ unique behaviors. It will range from classical approaches such as the agency theory, resource-based view, and stewardship to the original concepts and approaches coined by the family business literature, primarily discussing familiness, the three-circle model, and socioemotional wealth theory.","Amato, Stefano;Patuelli, Alessia",57216126995;57063166100
10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.133723,17,"In 2015, the United Nations established 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be reached by 2030. They are aimed at all members of society, including businesses, which could integrate SDGs within their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategies. As family firms constitute the most widespread form of business, understanding the factors that drive the decisions to pursue SDGs is essential. Thus, this research aims to understand why a family firm complies with SDGs. Additionally, it examines how SDGs enter, at the strategic level, activities and management practices. Following the case study method, the paper focuses on a family firm based in Italy, by means of documentary analysis, semi-structured interviews, and online data. In line with the Socioemotional Wealth (SEW) theory, family and personal values are crucial. While SDGs are only now entering the strategic level, their rationale has always been part of the family values, and the firm's culture. The selected firm is pursuing ten Goals. SDGs serve as a further motivator for family firms to behave more responsibly, meaning that they help to align the firm's strategy with the global challenges, building on existing family and firm's values. Our paper brings several contributions to the family business, CSR and SDGs literature, providing a representation of the reasons why a family firm pursues SDGs and the first reaction phases to SDGs. It brings practical implications for policymakers, highlighting the role of family values as the main drivers of the choice to invest in SDGs. By providing unique evidence, it is the first to connect the family business literature, CSR and SDGs.","Patuelli, Alessia;Carungu, Jonida;Lattanzi, Nicola",57063166100;57211555451;56136055200
10.1371/journal.pone.0254748,14,"This paper offers insights on the major issues and challenges firms face in the Covid-19 pandemic and their concerns for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) themes. To do so, we investigate large Italian firms’ discussions on Twitter in the first nine months of the pandemic. Specifically, we ask: How is firms’ Twitter discussion developing during the Covid-19 pandemic? Which CSR dimensions and topics do firms discuss? To what extent do they resonate with the public? We downloaded Twitter posts by the accounts of large Italian firms, and we built the bipartite network of accounts and hashtags. Using an entropy-based null model as a benchmark, we projected the information contained in the network into the accounts layers, identifying a network of accounts. We find that the network is composed of 13 communities and accounts at the core of the network focus on environmental sustainability, digital innovation, and safety. Firms’ ownership type does not seem to influence the conversation. While the relevance of CSR hashtags and stakeholder engagement is relatively small, peculiarities arise in some communities. Overall, our paper highlights the contribution of online social networks and complex networks methods for management and strategy research, showing the role of online social media in understanding firms’ issues, challenges, and responsibilities, with common narratives naturally emerging from data.","Patuelli, Alessia;Caldarelli, Guido;Lattanzi, Nicola;Saracco, Fabio",57063166100;55139905100;56136055200;36344077800

10.12871/000398292021341,1,"A long tradition of research has shown that personality traits, such as extraversion and agreeableness, and interpersonal constructs better predict job performance with a tacit but not explicit distinction in sales marketing activities. In this contribution, we aim to understand the role of job-related and interest data, interpersonal, and personality traits in affecting either inbound or outbound marketing activities and the overall sales performance. An original questionnaire integrates the interpersonal traits and personality factors reported in the literature in sales marketing activities (independent variables). The results were matched with the individual job-related and interest data (control variables) and sales performance (criterion variables) – expressed as the total number of closed contracts over the inbound/outbound related contacts of employees with responsibility in marketing activities for a large banking group. We are able to identify the relevant predictors of sales performance by creating full binary trees using control and independent variables in conditional inference forests and variable importance index measures. Higher performers in either inbound or outbound marketing activities rely on distinct personality sub-traits, which have fundamentally essential implications for interpersonal functioning, and personal data when agreeableness is central to the ability to function effectively in the interpersonal realm of sales activity","Malizia, Andrea P.;Bassetti, Thomas;Menicagli, Dario;Patuelli, Alessia;D’Arcangelo, Sonia;Lattanzi, Nicola;Bossi, Francesco;Mastrogiorgio, Antonio",16028897900;36547427100;57199647974;57063166100;57463509700;56136055200;56963595100;56072400100

It compares the last 20 years of Italian and Spanish accounting journals, developing a content analysis of each issue in the 20-year time frame from 1994 to 2014. Highlighting common trends and insights, this article adds to previous literature that examines publishing patterns of research in accounting journals from a historical point of view. It demonstrates that accounting research is developing beyond the institutional paradigm, showing an internationalisation process and trends consistent with Anglo-Saxon Journals.","Patuelli, Alessia;Carungu, Jonida",57063166100;57211555451
10.1007/978-3-030-64583-0_3,0,"According to a recent trend of research, there is a growing interest in applications of machine learning techniques to business analytics. In this work, both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques are applied to the analysis of a dataset made of both family and non-family firms. This is worth investigating, because the two kinds of firms typically differ in some aspects related to performance, which can be reflected in balance sheet data. First, binary classification techniques are applied to discriminate the two kinds of firms, by combining an unlabeled dataset with the labels provided by a survey. The most important features for performing such binary classification are identified. Then, clustering is applied to highlight why supervised learning can be effective in the previous task, by showing that most of the largest clusters found are quite unequally populated by the two classes.","Gnecco, Giorgio;Amato, Stefano;Patuelli, Alessia;Lattanzi, Nicola",22953696000;57216126995;57063166100;56136055200
10.17408/RIREAJCAPGZ050607082019,0,"Consistently with the social and institutional paradigm, countries with similar culture, such as Italy and Spain, could show similar trends in the development of accounting methods and research. Also developing the Comparative International Accounting History (CIAH) perspective, this research analyses and compares publication patterns in accounting from an historical point of view, aiming at understanding emerging topics and trends. It considers 20 years of an Italian accounting journal (RIREA) and a Spanish one (REFC), as both journals well represent Italian and Spanish accounting traditions. Specifically, the paper focuses on analysing and comparing authorship and topics trends, developing a content analysis of each issue between 1994 and 2014. Considering the single article as a research unit, in the first phase we collected the indices, titles, authors, affiliations, abstracts or introductions from each journal. Then we built a database with more than 1,600 articles. Adapting previous methods, we coded the database to classify the main themes, research and time settings. Finally, we analysed and compared the trends of both papers. Results show many common patterns in the Spanish and Italian accounting journals starting from topics, authorship patterns, time and empirical settings. Both countries experience a significant increase of multi-authored papers, meaning that the exchange of ideas in accounting research is growing. There is growing interest in cross-country setting, which confirms a trend towards internationalisation. This research contributes to compare different non Anglo-Saxon countries’ accounting research, highlighting common trends and confirming previous literature.","Carungu, Jonida;Patuelli, Alessia",57211555451;57063166100

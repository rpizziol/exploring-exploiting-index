10.15168/2284-4503-2761,0,"Can the digital revolution transform the very idea of the state and its functioning? The article investigates the ways in which technologies are influencing public institutions and their functioning, with particular regard to the contemporary and ‘democratic’ model of the state that was established in the 20th century. A first group of influences concerns the modes of exercising sovereignty and, in particular, the fundamental functions of the state. Therefore, the techniques of so-called direct democracy and their limits in pursuing the utopia of law-making by the people, the use of algorithms by judges, and the increasing spread of automated administrative decisions are examined. A second group of conditioning refers to the effects that the technological revolution has on the other two elements of the state, the people and the territory. Issues concerning the protection of fundamental rights, border crises, the relationship between technology and information and, consequently, between democracy and truth are then analyzed. From these constraints emerges a model based on ‘surveillance’, in which big data, their use and protection have acquired a strategic role. A model whose spread has undoubtedly in-creased with the pandemic, but also highlighted its limits and possible countermeasures. The digital revolution, the dominant role of Big Tech and social network, and the increasing use of artificial intelligence are profoundly affecting public institutions and civil society: what is the future of the (digital) State?","Casini, Lorenzo",15080701600

These issues are the multi-fold dimensions of global administrative law and the role of the law of global governance before new technologies, with particular reference to fake news and disinformation, which is probably one of the most harmful contemporary threats against democracy in our time.","Casini, Lorenzo",15080701600

The analysis deals with three main issues: the creation of a national system of museums and the recognition of the autonomy of state museums; the institutional models and the legal status of state museums; and the strategic role played by the Ministry’s field offices (the 'soprintendenze').","Casini, Lorenzo",15080701600

10.1111/nana.12377,4,"This article focuses on the (ambiguous) relationships between nationalism and international regulation of historic buildings, namely, the activity of UNESCO in this field. It studies two different forms of UNESCO intervention: the creation of a list of world heritage sites of outstanding universal value, which includes several historic cities and buildings; and UNESCO Recommendations aimed at protecting historic urban landscape. The article shows that UNESCO seems to favour both political and cultural forms of nationalism and can significantly affect the nationalistic use of historic buildings and, more broadly, affect on the very idea of Nation and nationalism.","Casini, Lorenzo",15080701600

10.1017/CBO9781316442777,21,"Comparative Regional Integration: Governance and Legal Models is a groundbreaking comparative study on regional or supranational integration through international and regional organizations. It provides the first comprehensive and empirically based analysis of governance systems by drawing on an original sample of 87 regional and international organizations. The authors explain how and why different organizations select specific governance processes and institutional choices, and outline which legal instruments - regulatory, organizational or procedural - are adopted to achieve integration. They reveal how different objectives influence institutional design and the integration model, for example a free trade area could insist on supremacy and refrain from adopting instruments for indirect rule, while a political union would rather engage with all available techniques. This ambitious work merges different backgrounds and disciplines to provide researchers and practitioners with a unique toolbox of institutional processes and legal mechanisms, and a classification of different models of regional and international integration.","Closa, Carlos;Casini, Lorenzo;Sender, Omri",22949901500;15080701600;57199500570

10.1093/icon/mou015,19,"This article deals with two of the greatest ""dualisms"" present in contemporary legal systems: the distinction between international law and domestic law on the one hand, and the distinction between public law and private law, on the other. The evolution of these two great dualisms is linked to the emergence of global public interests, the strategic role played by states and domestic administrations in the global arena, and the need to control and review how global hybrid institutions exercise their increasing powers. This contributes significantly to the emergence of multipolar administrative law, in which both public and private traits, and both domestic and international dimensions, constantly interact. Beyond the state, public and private law finds new ways of combining, borrowing tools and imitating solutions. In particular, when the public/private distinction goes international, it operates as a technology of global governance: it is a ""proxy"" for bringing given values into a new legal context and for recreating a ""familiar"" legal endeavor beyond the state. But this projection can be problematic: like in Lewis Carroll's ""rabbit-hole,"" there is no guarantee that, when the values and legal mechanisms behind them are moved from one level to another, they will remain the same. © The Author 2014.

10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199658589.003.0019,0,"In addressing the 'two-way' street as an essential characteristic of informal international lawmaking (IN-LAW), this chapter analyses the role of domestic public authorities within global networks. According to the chapter, the very idea of IN-LAW cannot be understood without considering the interplay between national and global actors. The chapter thus examines how public bodies (referred to as domestic 'terminals') take part in the global networks and how this participation affects domestic legal orders. Many of the global networks are in fact hybrid public-private networks and the role of private actors is obvious. Two main issues guide the analysis: the institutional and procedural design of global networks, especially in terms of their domestic dimension; and the existing accountability and review mechanisms.","Casini, Lorenzo",15080701600
10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199658244.003.0018,18,"This chapter addresses several arguments for and against the regulation of various global indicators. It uses the rating produced by credit rating agencies and argues that, in normative terms, the resolve as to whether a regulatory framework is needed depends on factors such as the kinds of users involved. It also presents a taxonomy of various conditions of use, uses, and types of indicators. This taxonomy would help in distinguishing cases where indicators as accountability-enhancers need protection from regulation.","Cassese, Sabino;Casini, Lorenzo",11640983500;15080701600
10.1093/icon/mor040,15,"Cultural property offers a significant yet ambiguous example of the development of global regulatory regimes beyond the State. On the one hand, traditional international law instruments do not seem to ensure an adequate level of protection for cultural heritage; securing such protection requires procedures, norms, and standards produced by global institutions, both public (such as UNESCO) and private (such as the International Council of Museums). On the other hand, a comprehensive global regulatory regime to complement the law of cultural property is still to be achieved. Instead, more regimes are being established, depending on the kind of properties and public interests at stake. Moreover, the huge cultural bias that dominates the debate about cultural property accentuates the ""clash of civilizations"" that already underlies the debate about global governance. The analysis of the relationship between globalization and cultural property, therefore, sheds light on broader global governance trends and helps highlight the points of weakness and strength in the adoption of administrative law techniques at the global level. © The Author 2011.

,2,"The adoption of equalisation and compensation mechanisms within the urban plan for Rome proved to be quite controversial. The regional law provides nearly no provisions for governing such planning tools, and the regulations set out by the plan introduce a somewhat complex system. The present paper, after a brief presentation of the history of land ownership and development within the city, will focus on the main features of equalisation and compensation practices which aim at governing the distribution of development rights among landowners and developers.","Casini, Lorenzo",15080701600
10.1163/157237409X12670188734311,75,"Several important legal features of the contemporary practice of international organizations (IOs) are not easily accommodated in standard approaches to international organizations law. This article argues that Global Administrative Law (GAL) approaches may strengthen analysis of operational issues such as emergency actions by IOs and the human rights implications of IO activities, structural issues such as the involvement of IOs in field missions and in public-private partnerships, and normative issues concerning the production and effects of non-treaty regulatory instruments by IOs (guidelines, best practices, national policy assessments, and other documents rather amorphously analyzed under the 'soft law' rubric). In examining these activities as forms of administration (broadly understood), subject to precepts of good administration and legal standards concerning transparency, participation, reason-giving, review, and accountability, a GAL perspective provides a basis both for critique of problematic practices, and for increasing the effectiveness and legitimacy of some beneficial IO activities which are contentious or currently not undertaken. GAL also responds to the proliferation and differentiation of IOs and other entities in global governance through applying legal standards to their interactions, bringing a principled 'inter-public' approach to the legal relations among global public entities. GAL provides a valuable, and thus far overly neglected, addition to the field of international institutional law. © 2009 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.","Kingsbury, Benedict;Casini, Lorenzo",11640689200;15080701600

This article examines the structure and activities of this institution, in order to highlight a number of problems concerning the increasing use of public-private partnerships (PPPs) at the global level: the spread of normative functions carried out by global institutions and the binding force of these norms; the harmonization of different regulations at the global level; and the adoption of administrative law type mechanisms within global regimes and the emergence of global administrative law. © 2009 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.","Casini, Lorenzo",15080701600

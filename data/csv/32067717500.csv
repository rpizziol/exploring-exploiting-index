10.1109/TDSC.2023.3236798,3,"The rising of the Cyber-Physical System (CPS) and the Industry 4.0 paradigms demands the design and implementation of Digital Twin Frameworks (DTFs) that may support the quick build of reliable Digital Twins (DTs) for experimental and testing purposes. Most of the current DTF proposals allow the generation of DTs at a good pace but affect generality, scalability, portability, and completeness. As a consequence, current DTF are mostly domain-specific and hardly span several application domains (e.g., from simple IoT deployments to the modeling of complex critical infrastructures). Furthermore, the generated DTs often requires a high amount of computational resource to run. In this paper, we present LiDiTE, a solution based on a novel reference model for general-purpose DTFs. LiDiTE overcomes the limitations of state-of-the-art tools by supporting the fine-grained development of real-world complexity scenarios. To achieve that, LiDiTE builds on technologies that favor scalability, reuse, and extensibility of scenarios. We show such features by building the DT of real critical infrastructure and evaluating the performance of our DT against those of the real system. Further contributions of this paper include open access to the source code of LiDiTE and the experimental dataset.","Russo, Enrico;Costa, Gabriele;Longo, Giacomo;Armando, Alessandro;Merlo, Alessio",57197855120;32067717500;57468566600;57190072464;15136674200
10.1145/3600160.3605009,0,"The gender gap is one of the main concerns in the IT sector, in general, and in cybersecurity, in particular. Although well known, the problem is multifaceted and some of its root causes may be found in the education system. In the last years, many initiatives have been proposed targeting high-school students that might be interested in cybersecurity. Many of these programs rely on capture-the-flag (CTF) competitions to gradually form technical skills in an entertaining way. Despite these efforts, however, the number of girls that attend and complete these programs is still often unsatisfactory. In this work, we present the most significant outcomes of CyberTrials, a CTF-based cybersecurity program for Italian high school girls that this year enrolled 941 students. The two main features of CyberTrials are its peculiar organization and its gaming platform, which introduces some crucial novelties w.r.t. other similar initiatives. Both these aspects are presented and discussed in this paper. The results show that our methodology could effectively engage the participants and that when properly organized, CTF-based events have the potential to catalyze the learning process.","Costa, Gabriele;De Francisci, Silvia;Valiani, Serenella;Prinetto, Paolo",32067717500;35847465800;57893691300;7005222576
10.1016/j.cose.2023.103133,0,"Physical layer security mechanisms use primitives that exploit physical properties of the communication channel to protect data. Protecting communications at the physical layer offers some advantages, e.g., in terms of reduced computations, since complex cryptographic procedures are not executed, However, these mechanisms lack a formal specification that prevent protocols and applications that use them from being verified and compared with those based on cyptography. Here we start filling this gap by providing an axiomatization of key physical layer security primitives and proposing a variant of the Dolev–Yao attacker model that takes them into account. We show that our formalization enables applying existing automatic tools for verifying security of protocols. Then, we show that these primitives are a valuable alternative and effective complement to cryptography, because they ensure confidentiality and integrity but require a lower energy consumption and often they also reduce transmission time. Finally, we characterize the specific application domains and network features that make adopting these security mechanisms particularly profitable with respect to the AES cypher.","Costa, Gabriele;Degano, Pierpaolo;Galletta, Letterio;Soderi, Simone",32067717500;7006345611;55260418300;56027760800
,0,"Network scanning is a common task in cybersecurity. For instance, penetration testers often scan a target system during the initial stage of their vulnerability detection process, e.g., for profiling machines and services. On the other hand, attackers scan remote systems looking for exploitation opportunities. Network scans are generally considered harmless for the victim, as they only consist of a few requests that cause no service interruption or degradation. Nevertheless, as shown in [1], scanning is risky for its author. In this paper, we present a general attack framework that takes advantage of network scans for injecting remote systems. In particular, our proposal leverages the widely adopted scanner Nmap [2] for transmitting attack payloads through the scan responses. If the output of Nmap is processed by an injectable application, e.g., a web browser of a SQL DBMS, our payloads are executed and the scanning system gets compromised.","Bonfiglio, Alessandro;Costa, Gabriele;De Francisci, Silvia",58648035800;32067717500;35847465800
10.58346/JOWUA.2022.I4.004,12,"A cyber range (CR) is an environment used for training security experts and testing attack and defense tools and procedures. Usually, a cyber range simulates one or more critical infrastructures that attacking (red) and defending (blue) teams must compromise and protect, respectively. The infrastructure can be physically assembled, but much more convenient is to rely on the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) paradigm. Although some modern technologies support the IaaS, the design and deployment of scenarios of interest are mostly manual. As a consequence, it is a common practice to have a cyber range hosting few (sometimes only one), consolidated scenarios. However, reusing the same scenario may significantly reduce the effectiveness of the training and testing sessions. In this paper, we propose a framework for automating the definition and deployment of arbitrarily complex cyber range scenarios. The framework relies on the virtual scenario description language (VSDL), i.e., a domain-specific language for defining high-level features of the desired infrastructure while hiding low-level details. The semantics of VSDL is given in terms of constraints that must be satis-fied by the virtual infrastructure. These constraints are then submitted to an SMT solver to check the satisfiability of the specification. If satisfiable, the specification gives rise to a model that is automat-ically converted to a set of deployment scripts to be submitted to the IaaS provider.","Costa, Gabriele;Russo, Enrico;Armando, Alessandro",32067717500;57197855120;57190072464
10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3229124,1,"Federated learning (FL) goes beyond traditional, centralized machine learning by distributing model training among a large collection of edge clients. These clients cooperatively train a global, e.g., cloud-hosted, model without disclosing their local, private training data. The global model is then shared among all the participants which use it for local predictions. This paper proves that FL systems can be turned into covert channels to implement a stealth communication infrastructure. The main intuition is that, during federated training, a malicious sender can poison the global model by submitting purposely crafted examples. Although the effect of the model poisoning is negligible to other participants and does not alter the overall model performance, it can be observed by a malicious receiver and used to transmit a sequence of bits. We mounted our attack on an FL system to verify its feasibility. Experimental evidence shows that this covert channel is reliable, efficient, and extremely hard to counter. These results highlight that our new attacker model threatens FL infrastructures.","Costa, Gabriele;Pinelli, Fabio;Soderi, Simone;Tolomei, Gabriele",32067717500;57223750427;56027760800;12784026600
10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3218412,4,"Modern Intelligent Infrastructures (II) are highly complex, interconnected systems that are now emerging. For instance, II can integrate technologies and processes to provide citizens with faster services and better goods. An average II can include many technologies, e.g., Cloud applications and IoT devices, under different environments, e.g., industry 4.0 production plants and smart buildings. Although II bring concrete benefits to all of these contexts, they also carry security concerns. Reasoning about threats and security exposures that might affect II is non-trivial. This is only partially due to their inherent complexity. As a matter of fact, real II are typically in charge of some critical operations that cannot be interrupted or compromised for experimental purposes. An alternative solution is to rely on digital replicas which can provide a good trade-off between realism and usability. These assets represent a strategic and highly demanded resource for the security community. In this paper, we present HArMoNICS, a case study infrastructure meant to provide a playground for security experts interested in II security. HArMoNICS revolves around a digital replica of a real Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) located in Italy. Although most of the components are based on or inspired by the real system, HArMoNICS has been enriched with further security-relevant features. As a result, the case study includes vertical use cases focusing on specific security topics.

,0,"Malware is a constant threat for the security of devices and users. Successful and automatic malware detection is a critical necessity [1]. Existing malware detection solutions cannot accurately characterize the behavior of a malware and, thereby, they rely on other indicators, e.g., digital signatures. Nevertheless, behavior-based detection is an active field of research since it can deal with zero-day malware. Although many proposals leveraging machine learning (ML) classifiers have been put forward, finding proper behavioral features is still an open problem. Existing solutions typically consider either static or dynamic software features. Static refers to the program syntax while dynamic refers to features observed at runtime. However, both of them suffer from limitations which impact on the effectiveness of the ML classification. Here we follow a different approach. We used symbolic execution to model features that denote the malware behavior in a more precise way. To this aim, we introduce a novel feature specification language called Symbolic Feature Specification Language (SFSL). Each rule precisely models a specific malicious behavior that has been documented in past malware samples. Then, we apply local, bounded symbolic exploration to establish whether a binary under analysis matches the defined rules. Eventually, the result of the rule matching process is used to generate vectors of features for a ML classifier. Our current experiments with different ML classifiers show that this technique can lead to actual improvements of the classification accuracy. Moreover, since behavioral features do not depend on the program syntax, our methodology can even detect threats in new malware samples.","Siwach, Chinmay;Costa, Gabriele;de Nicola, Rocco",57258768000;32067717500;7004298169

Scan reports can be vulnerable to injection attacks, thus putting the browser of the scanner user at risk. To the best of our knowledge, DVAS is the only environment for practicing under the new attacker model. Without proper training and education, this kind of flaws are likely to be neglected by developers and security analysts.

When it does not, it would be helpful to determine which modules are incorrect. As a consequence, specification decomposition is a relevant problem from both a theoretical and practical point of view. Until now, specification decomposition has been independently addressed by the control theory and verification communities through natural projection and partial model checking, respectively. We prove that natural projection reduces to partial model checking and, when cast in a common setting, the two are equivalent. Apart from their foundational interest, our results build a bridge whereby the control theory community can reuse algorithms and results developed by the verification community. Furthermore, we extend the notions of natural projection and partial model checking from finite-state to symbolic transition systems and we show that the equivalence still holds. Symbolic transition systems are more expressive than traditional finite-state transition systems, as they can model large systems, whose behavior depends on the data handled, and not only on the control flow. Finally, we present an algorithm for the partial model checking of both kinds of systems that can be used as an alternative to natural projection.","Costa, Gabriele;Galletta, Letterio;Degano, Pierpaolo;Basin, David;Bodei, Chiara",32067717500;55260418300;7006345611;7003799223;6603107885

We report our experience in developing and applying a security policy based on the existing guidelines of the NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI Agency).","Armando, Alessandro;Costa, Gabriele;Merlo, Alessio;Verderame, Luca;Wrona, Konrad",57190072464;32067717500;15136674200;55315179600;57188669217

Unfortunately, standard signature schemes are not well suited for use in conjunction with program transformation techniques, such as aspect-oriented programming. With these techniques, code development is performed in sequence by multiple teams of programmers. This is fundamentally different from traditional single-developer/ single-user models, where users can verify end-to-end (i.e., developer-to-user) authenticity of the code using digital signatures. To address this limitation, we introduce FLEX, a exible code authentication framework for mobile applications. FLEX allows semi-trusted intermediaries to modify mobile code without invalidating the developer's signature, as long as the modification complies with a ""contract"" issued by the developer. We introduce formal definitions for secure code modification, and show that our instantiation of FLEX is secure under these definitions. Although FLEX can be instantiated using any language, we design AMJ - a novel programming language that supports code annotations - and implement a FLEX prototype based on our new language.","Costa, Gabriele;Gasti, Paolo;Merlo, Alessio;Yu, Shung Hsi",32067717500;26428760400;15136674200;57190395470

The goal of MAVeriC is to implement a unified service which takes advantage of the state-of-the-art technologies for creating detailed risk profiles of mobile applications. In this paper we present the Dynamic Analysis Module (DAM) of the MAVeriC platform. Briefly, its objective is to interact with a running Android application for inferring as much information as possible about its behavior. The interaction is carried out by simulating the activity of the user. In the meanwhile, monitoring modules observe the operations executed by the application, i.e., network usage and file access. Finally, a modeling module factorizes the gathered information for providing the analysis with an abstract representation of the application behavior.","Armando, Alessandro;Bocci, Gianluca;Costa, Gabriele;Mammoliti, Rocco;Merlo, Alessio;Ranise, Silvio;Traverso, Riccardo;Valenza, Andrea",57190072464;56465594900;32067717500;18935973300;15136674200;6603468509;53364493900;57090187700

It is based of three main concepts: the application code, the application contract, and the system security policy The level of trust we consider measures the adherence of the application code to its contract, i.e., if the code respects its contract then the application is trusted, otherwise its level of trust decreases. According to the level of trust of the application, SxCxT decides if check the contract against the policies and if the answer is positive, execute the application just monitoring its contract, or directly enforce the security policy set on the platform.

As a matter of fact, defining global security properties on distribute, large-scale network seems to have little or even no sense at all. In a recent proposal, every single service specify its ad hoc security policies that are applied to (parts of) programs or services. These are called local policies and are amenable for developers. They are specified using a simple automaton-like structure, they offer full compositionality (through scope nesting) and a direct enforcing through a corresponding execution monitor. Compliance w.r.t. local policies is statically verified against a superset of the possible program execution traces, namely a history expression. History expressions for services are obtained through a type and effect system and then model checked for validity. A valid history expression only contains traces that never rise policy exceptions. Such history expressions drive the synthesis of composition plans, i.e. safe service orchestration. In this paper this approach is extended to work also on open networks, i.e. networks that are only partially specified. This allows one to compose services in a bottom-up fashion, while guaranteeing their correctness by construction.

10.1016/j.cose.2009.07.005,15,"Many modern mobile devices, such as mobile phones or Personal digital assistants (PDAs), are able to run Java applications, such as games, Internet browsers, chat tools and so on. These applications perform some operations on the mobile device, that are critical from the security point of view, such as connecting to the Internet, sending and receiving SMS messages, connecting to other devices through the Bluetooth interface, browsing the user's contact list, and so on. Hence, an adequate security support is required to protect the device from malicious applications. This paper proposes an enhanced security support for next generation Java Micro Edition platform. This support performs a runtime monitoring of the operations performed by the Java applications, and enforces a security policy that defines which operations applications are allowed to perform. Two possible design approaches for the security support are presented and compared. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

,17,"Security-by-Contract (S×C) is a paradigm providing security assurances for mobile applications. In this work, we present the an extension of S×C, called Security-by-Contract-with-Trust (S×C×T). Indeed, we enrich the S×C architecture by integrating a trust model and adding new modules and configurations for managing contracts. Indeed, at deploy-time, our system decides the run-time configuration depending on the credentials of the contract provider. The run-time environment can both enforce a security policy and monitor the declared contract. According to the actual behaviour of the running program our architecture updates the trust level associated with the contract provider. We also present a possible application of our framework in the scenario of a mobile application marketplace, e.g., Apple AppStore, Cydia, Android Market, that, nowadays, are considered as one of the most attractive e-commerce activity for both mobile application developers and industries of mobile devices. Since the number of applications increases, Mobile Applications Marketplace (MAMp) sets up recommendation systems that rank and highlight mobile applications by category, social activity, etc. The S×C×T framework we propose is applied in this scenario for providing security on customers' mobile devices as well as help Mobile Applications Marketplaces to enhance their recommendation systems with security feedback. The main advantage of this method is an automatic management of the level of trust of software and contract releasers and a unified way for dealing with both security and trust.","Costa, Gabriele;Lazouski, Aliaksandr;Martinelli, Fabio;Matteucci, Ilaria;Issarny, Vaĺerie;Saadi, Rachid;Dragoni, Nicola;Massacci, Fabio",32067717500;26644852600;7006394072;15835201800;6701338436;23092361900;8308455900;55167501300
10.1109/SEEFM.2009.13,2,"Local policies represent security properties that are applied to (parts of) programs or services. They are amenable for developers since they provide for a full compositionality (through scope nesting), for a simple, automaton-like structure and for a direct enforcing through a corresponding execution monitor. Compliance w.r.t. local policies is statically verified against a safe over-approximation of all the possible execution traces, namely a history expression. Given a service, a safe type and effect system extracts a history expression, from which a viable composition plan can be automatically produced. Viable plans drive executions that never rise policy exceptions. Our main contribution consists in defining a type and effect system that also deals with open systems. We extend the syntax of a service-oriented version of the λ- calculus, namely λreq, with resources and external branching operators. Then, we safely over-approximate the possible run-time behaviour of services collecting partial information on the relationship between the program flow and the actual resources. Indeed, the history expressions obtained in this way are compact, rather accurate and able to derive viable plans in most cases. © 2009 IEEE.","Costa, Gabriele;Degano, Pierpaolo;Martinelli, Fabio",32067717500;7006345611;7006394072

More specifically, the application that we developed is able to intercept images received through various communication channels (bluetooth, MMS) on mobile devices based on the Symbian#8482; operating systems. Once intercepted, the images are analysed by the component of the system that automatically classify images with explicit sexual content. At the current stage the application that intercept images runs on the mobile device, the classifier runs on a remote server.

Policies are defined by usage automata, that recognize the forbidden execution histories. Usage automata are expressive enough to allow programmers specify of many real-world usage policies; yet, they are simple enough to permit formal reasoning. Programmers can sandbox untrusted pieces of code with usage policies. The Jalapa tool rewrites the Java bytecode by adding the hooks for the mechanism that enforces the given policies at run-time. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

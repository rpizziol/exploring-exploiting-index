10.3390/ijerph20176634,0,"Cognitive insight refers to the ability to question one’s judgments and cognitive biases and is underpinned by specific metacognitive processes. The Beck Cognitive Insight Scale was developed to assess cognitive insight and includes two subscales, Self-Reflectiveness and Self-Certainty (SC). The present study aimed to investigate the underlying factor structure of the Italian version of the BCIS in patients with schizophrenia (SZ) and in the general population (GP) for the first time. A cross-sectional design was adopted and a GP sample of 624 subjects and an SZ sample of 130 patients were enrolled. In the SZ group, a two-factor solution was supported. The internal reliability of each factor was satisfactory. Two items were eliminated and one item moved from the SC to the SR subscale. In the GP group, a two-factor solution was highlighted. The internal reliability of each factor was satisfactory. However, four items of the SR subscale were deleted. The Italian-validated version of the BCIS shows different structures for the SZ and the GP and is characterized by different features concerning previous studies. This evidence suggests new interpretations of metacognitive processes in the two populations and implies specific therapeutic approaches.","Orfei, Maria Donata;Porcari, Desirée Estela;Spalletta, Gianfranco;Assogna, Francesca;Piras, Fabrizio;Banaj, Nerisa;Ricciardi, Emiliano",57192322263;57220078252;57201126550;24528556300;57576967000;56194289200;8565770200
10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1253960,0,"Introduction: Technostress (TS) represents a multidimensional phenomenon closely related to the pervasive use of information and communication technologies. This study aimed to validate a new psychometric tool for assessing TS in an Italian banking context, the Work-Related Technostress – Questionnaire (WRT-Q). Secondly, we analyzed the role of gender and age in modulating TS manifestations. Methods: A sample of 2,586 bank employees (51% females; age: 47.26 ± 8.6) underwent an online survey. Reliability, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), ANCOVA, independent sample t-test, and correlation analyses were performed. Results: The WRT-Q consisted of 17 items and a four-factor structure, supported by the following CFA indices: Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0.985; Incremental Fit Index (IFI) = 0.985; Goodness of Fit (GFI) = 0.988; Root Mean Squared Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.071; and SRMR = 0.062. A significant difference in TS levels between age classes emerged (p < 0.001) with higher levels in the over 55-year-old subgroup, while no statistically significant difference emerged for gender. Moreover, the whole sample found a significant positive association between age and TS (p < 0.001). Discussion: The WRT-Q is a new instrument to measure TS in the workplace, it can contribute to highlighting adverse outcomes in individuals due to a dysfunctional interaction with ICT.","Porcari, Desirée Estela;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Orfei, Maria Donata",57220078252;8565770200;57192322263

The present study had the objective to develop training to facilitate the management of work-related technostress. A sample of 236 voluntary bank employees underwent an initial survey and a training protocol to mitigate and relieve technostress effects. Finally, they filled in the survey again. Within-group analyses were performed comparing pre- against post-training scores. Furthermore, between-group analyses compared the post-training results of the experimental group to those of a control group that answered the initial survey, but did not perform the training. Results showed that in the experimental group, the post-training levels of technostress were reduced with respect to pre-training scores and were lower than in the control group. Our data showed that a multifaceted approach could stimulate the development of effective screening procedures and intervention strategies to enhance a healthy interaction between individuals and IT.","Orfei, Maria Donata;Porcari, Desirèè Estela;D’Arcangelo, Sonia;Maggi, Francesca;Russignaga, Dario;Ricciardi, Emiliano",57192322263;57220078252;57463509700;57232266500;6506912623;8565770200

Our study aimed to explore the relationship between brain fog, neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms in the general population. A sample of 441 subjects underwent a web-based survey, including the PANAS, the DASS-21, the IES-R, the Beck Cognitive Insight Scale, and a questionnaire investigating demographic information, brain fog, subjective cognitive impairments (Scc) and sleep disorders. ANOVA, ANCOVA, correlation and multiple stepwise regression analyses were performed. In our sample, 33% of participants were defined as Healthy Subjects (HS; no brain fog, no Scc), 27% as Probable Brain Fog (PBF; brain fog or Scc), and 40% as Functional Brain Fog (FBF; brain fog plus Scc). PBF and FBF showed higher levels of neuropsychiatric symptoms than HS, and FBF showed the worst psychological outcome. Moreover, worse cognitive symptoms were related to the female gender, greater neuropsychiatric symptoms, sleep disorders, and rumination/indecision. Being a woman and more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms were predictors of FBF severity. Our data pointed out a high prevalence and various levels of severity and impairments of brain fog, suggesting a classificatory proposal and a multifaceted etiopathogenic model, thus facilitating adequate diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","Orfei, Maria Donata;Porcari, Desirée Estela;D’Arcangelo, Sonia;Maggi, Francesca;Russignaga, Dario;Ricciardi, Emiliano",57192322263;57220078252;57463509700;57232266500;6506912623;8565770200

Simple slope analyses highlighted that women, lower age, and suppression were related to higher scores for the PANAS negative affect scale, the DASS-21, the IES-R, the GHQ, and the DUWAS. In our sample, 1.2% of participants showed depressive symptoms, 0.5% anxiety symptoms, and 2% stress symptoms. Moreover, 5.4% of participants reported post-traumatic symptoms and 15% signs of psychological distress. Compared with data on the lockdown period, our results show lower levels of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms, possibly due to the slackening of preventive measures adopted since June. Despite this, post-traumatic symptoms and signs of psychological distress were still present. Our data suggest the necessity to monitor psychological adaption over time in general and at-risk subjects.","Orfei, Maria Donata;Bossi, Francesco;D'Arcangelo, Sonia;Maggi, Francesca;Lattanzi, Nicola;Malizia, Andrea Patricelli;Ricciardi, Emiliano",57192322263;56963595100;57221913690;57232266500;56136055200;16028897900;8565770200
10.3389/fpsyg.2022.843095,14,"The COVID-19 evolution has forced the massive introduction of homeworking (HW) for most employees in the initial stages of the pandemic and then return to work, mainly due to the vaccination campaign. These multiple abrupt adjustment demands in work may be a source of intense stress for office workers with consequences on wellbeing and the quality of life. This long-term prospective study aimed at investigating the effect of adaptation demands on a broad population of employees of a large Italian banking group in the job-related stress framework. We administered a web-based survey to 1,264 participants in Reopening after the first lockdown, from June to October 2020, at 841 subjects in Second Wave, corresponding to the rise of contagions from November 2020 to January 2021, and to 491 individuals in Vaccination Round, which ranged from February to June 2021. We assessed workaholism by using the Dutch Work Addiction Scale (DUWAS-10), work-family conflicting overlap by using the Work and Family Conflict Scale (WAFCS), and concern for back to work (BW) and for HW by specific questions. Higher WAFCS scores characterized Reopening and Vaccination Round while Second Wave had the highest level of concern for HW. Women and younger individuals showed the highest concern for BW, WAFCS, and DUWAS-10 scores regardless of the pandemic stage. HW days per week were related to more heightened concern for BW and lower concern for HW, DUWAS, and WAFCS scores. The number of children was related to lower Concern for BW and higher WAFCS scores in Reopening and Second Wave. Our data showed that massive adjustment demands in work and family routine represented a significant source of stress for employees, regardless of the different pandemic stages. The highest level of fatigue emerged in women and younger subjects. These results shed light on the need for a road map to promote a gradual and structured adjustment for workers and encourage organizations to consider homeworking as a valid stable alternative.","Orfei, Maria Donata;Porcari, Desirée Estela;D’Arcangelo, Sonia;Maggi, Francesca;Russignaga, Dario;Lattanzi, Nicola;Malizia, Andrea Patricelli;Ricciardi, Emiliano",57192322263;57220078252;57463509700;57232266500;6506912623;56136055200;16028897900;8565770200

10.3389/fnins.2020.577978,6,"The frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) is a neurophysiological measure of motivation and preference. Despite the FAA is associated to commercial pleasantness, conflicting evidence emerged in the literature regarding its relationship with behavior. To study the association between FAA and consumers' decision, we manipulated a commercial script to elicit diverse consumers' attitudes and decisions and to evaluate whether the FAA score is associated to their final investment. A little informative script (S1) was used to polarize consumers' attitudes and investments toward unfavorable scores, while a more personalized message (S2) to elicit in customers a favorable attitude and higher investments. Twenty-one participants listened to the scripts, and their FAA, attitude, and monetary investment were measured. In S1, the FAA did not correlate with neither attitude nor the investment decision, while a robust negative correlation between these variables was found in S2. No other peripheral body and neural measures associated with attitude or final decision. Our data suggest that the FAA correlates with attitude and decision, when a commercial script is customized and provides an adequate information, likely leading the consumer to a more reasoned and planned decision-making process. When facilitating a favorable attitude toward an offer, the negative correlation of FAA and behavior may reflect the involvement of a control system, whose role is to monitor and govern possible conflicts between approach and avoidance motivations. This observation provides additional indication on the value of FAA as a marker of consumer behaviors, and how it could be affected by experimental and contextual bias.","Di Gruttola, Francesco;Malizia, Andrea P.;D'Arcangelo, Sonia;Lattanzi, Nicola;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Orfei, Maria Donata",56324294200;16028897900;57221913690;56136055200;8565770200;57192322263

10.1038/s41588-019-0358-2,1361,"Risk for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD), the most prevalent dementia, is partially driven by genetics. To identify LOAD risk loci, we performed a large genome-wide association meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed LOAD (94,437 individuals). We confirm 20 previous LOAD risk loci and identify five new genome-wide loci (IQCK, ACE, ADAM10, ADAMTS1, and WWOX), two of which (ADAM10, ACE) were identified in a recent genome-wide association (GWAS)-by-familial-proxy of Alzheimer’s or dementia. Fine-mapping of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region confirms the neurological and immune-mediated disease haplotype HLA-DR15 as a risk factor for LOAD. Pathway analysis implicates immunity, lipid metabolism, tau binding proteins, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, showing that genetic variants affecting APP and Aβ processing are associated not only with early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease but also with LOAD. Analyses of risk genes and pathways show enrichment for rare variants (P = 1.32 × 10−7), indicating that additional rare variants remain to be identified. We also identify important genetic correlations between LOAD and traits such as family history of dementia and education.","Kunkle, Brian W.;Grenier-Boley, Benjamin;Sims, Rebecca;Bis, Joshua C.;Damotte, Vincent;Naj, Adam C.;Boland, Anne;Vronskaya, Maria;van der Lee, Sven J.;Amlie-Wolf, Alexandre;Bellenguez, Céline;Frizatti, Aura;Chouraki, Vincent;Martin, Eden R.;Sleegers, Kristel;Badarinarayan, Nandini;Jakobsdottir, Johanna;Hamilton-Nelson, Kara L.;Moreno-Grau, Sonia;Olaso, Robert;Raybould, Rachel;Chen, Yuning;Kuzma, Amanda B.;Hiltunen, Mikko;Morgan, Taniesha;Ahmad, Shahzad;Vardarajan, Badri N.;Epelbaum, Jacques;Hoffmann, Per;Boada, Merce;Beecham, Gary W.;Garnier, Jean Guillaume;Harold, Denise;Fitzpatrick, Annette L.;Valladares, Otto;Moutet, Marie Laure;Gerrish, Amy;Smith, Albert V.;Qu, Liming;Bacq, Delphine;Denning, Nicola;Jian, Xueqiu;Zhao, Yi;Del Zompo, Maria;Fox, Nick C.;Choi, Seung Hoan;Mateo, Ignacio;Hughes, Joseph T.;Adams, Hieab H.;Malamon, John;Sanchez-Garcia, Florentino;Patel, Yogen;Brody, Jennifer A.;Dombroski, Beth A.;Naranjo, Maria Candida Deniz;Daniilidou, Makrina;Eiriksdottir, Gudny;Mukherjee, Shubhabrata;Wallon, David;Uphill, James;Aspelund, Thor;Cantwell, Laura B.;Garzia, Fabienne;Galimberti, Daniela;Hofer, Edith;Butkiewicz, Mariusz;Fin, Bertrand;Scarpini, Elio;Sarnowski, Chloe;Bush, Will S.;Meslage, Stéphane;Kornhuber, Johannes;White, Charles C.;Song, Yuenjoo;Barber, Robert C.;Engelborghs, Sebastiaan;Sordon, Sabrina;Voijnovic, Dina;Adams, Perrie M.;Vandenberghe, Rik;Mayhaus, Manuel;Cupples, L.

10.1007/s10072-019-03840-4,26,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia characterized by the prevalent memory impairment. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may represent the early stage of AD, in particular when MCI patients show biomarkers consistent with AD pathology (MCI due to AD). Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) frequently affect both MCI and AD patients. Cerebrospinal-fluid (CSF) tau and β-amyloid 42 (Aβ 42 ) levels are actually considered the most sensitive and specific biomarkers for AD neurodegeneration. In the present retrospective observational study, we evaluated CSF biomarkers and neuropsychological data (also including NPS measured by the neuropsychiatric inventory—NPI) in a population of patients affected by MCI due to AD compared with mild to moderate AD patients. We documented higher NPI scores in MCI compared with AD patients. In particular, sub-items related to sleep, appetite, irritability, depression, and anxiety were higher in MCI than AD. We also found the significant correlation between NPS and CSF AD biomarkers in the whole population of MCI and AD patients. Consistently, t-tau/Aβ 42 ratio correlated with NPS in all the MCI and AD patients. These results suggest the more prevalent occurrence of NPS in MCI patients showing AD pathology and converting to dementia than AD patients. Moreover, a more significant degree of AD neurodegeneration, featured by high t-tau/Aβ 42 ratio, correlated with more severe NPS, thus supposing that in MCI and AD patients a more extensive AD neurodegeneration is related to more severe behavioral disturbances.","Scaricamazza, Eugenia;Colonna, Isabella;Sancesario, Giulia Maria;Assogna, Francesca;Orfei, Maria Donata;Franchini, Flaminia;Sancesario, Giuseppe;Mercuri, Nicola Biagio;Liguori, Claudio",54986322300;57195968226;56260222500;24528556300;57192322263;57194615622;57210822411;7004633884;55066893500
10.1159/000492030,3,"Objective: Interaction between the nervous and immune systems may influence emotions, ultimately affecting human health. Cytokines may play a role in developing emotional dysregulation as in alexithymia, a personality construct characterized by the subclinical inability to identify and describe emotions, often associated with several psychiatric and psychosomatic disorders. The proinflammatory cytokine IL-18, with a recognized role in brain functions, may influence serotonin metabolism and appears to be associated with alexithymia. Healthy individuals carrying the long allele (L) of the serotonin transporter gene polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR), and thus having lower concentrations of serotonin in the synaptic cleft, show a greater tendency toward alexithymia, with some gender differences. To explore a potential physiological interaction between IL-18, serotonin neurotransmission, and alexithymia, we investigated whether IL-18 serum levels and 5-HTTLPR are linked to alexithymic traits in healthy subjects. Methods: We measured IL-18 serum levels in 115 Italian-Caucasian healthy subjects genotyped for 5-HTTLPR allele variants, divided by gender and assessed for alexithymia scores using the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale. Results: IL-18 levels are significantly more elevated in individuals with the LL genotype (n = 25) than in carriers of the short allele (n = 90, p = 0.0073). Specifically, in LL males (n = 11), i.e., the group with the most relevant increase in IL-18, cytokine values positively correlated with difficulty identifying feelings, which is a component of alexithymia (r = 0.634, p = 0.036). Conclusions: These results indicate a possible novel interaction between IL-18 and the serotoninergic system to mediate emotional unawareness, suggesting putative biological predictors of emotional dysregulation, which in turn can act as a risk factor for a variety of medical conditions in susceptible subjects.","Sacchinelli, Eleonora;Piras, Fabrizio;Orfei, Maria Donata;Banaj, Nerisa;Salani, Francesca;Ciaramella, Antonio;Caltagirone, Carlo;Spalletta, Gianfranco;Bossù, Paola",57193482958;55274309000;57192322263;56194289200;10140794900;7003470721;35228717800;57201126550;57214786019
10.3389/fnagi.2018.00285,16,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a fatal dementing neurodegenerative disease, currently lacking an efficacious disease-modifying therapy. In the last years, there has been some interest in the use of homotaurine as a potential therapeutic compound for AD, but more work is still needed to prove its efficacy as disease modifier in dementia. Since inflammation is believed to play a key role in AD development, we sought to investigate here the in vivo homotaurine effect on inflammatory response in patients at the earliest stages of AD, i.e., suffering from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Thus, the present study aims to evaluate the effects of homotaurine supplementation on cytokine serum levels and memory performances in MCI patients. Neuropsychological, clinical and cytokine assessment was performed at baseline (T0) and after 1 year (T12) of homotaurine supplementation in 20 patients categorized as carriers (n = 9) or no carriers (n = 11) of the ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, the strongest genetic risk factor for AD. The serum levels of the pro-inflammatory mediators Interleukin (IL) 1β, Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), IL-6 and IL-18, contextually with the anti-inflammatory molecules IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) and Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ), were analyzed to explore significant differences in the inflammatory status between T0 and T12 in the two APOE variant carrier groups. No significant differences over time were observed in patients as for most cytokines, except for IL-18. Following homotaurine supplementation, patients carrying the APOEε4 allele showed a significant decrease in IL-18 (both in its total and IL-18BP unbound forms), in turn associated with improved short-term episodic memory performance as measured by the recency effect of the Rey 15-word list learning test immediate recall. Thus, homotaurine supplementation in individuals with aMCI may have a positive consequence on episodic memory loss due, at least in part, to homotaurine anti-inflammatory effects. This study strongly suggests that future research should focus on exploring the mechanisms by which homotaurine controls brain inflammation during AD progression.","Bossu, Paola;Salani, Francesca;Ciaramella, Antonio;Sacchinelli, Eleonora;Mosca, Alessandra;Banaj, Nerisa;Assogna, Francesca;Orfei, Maria Donata;Caltagirone, Carlo;Gianni, Walter;Spalletta, Gianfranco",57214786019;10140794900;7003470721;57193482958;55875781600;56194289200;24528556300;57192322263;35228717800;6701691226;57201126550
10.1016/j.parkreldis.2018.04.015,28,"Introduction: Anosognosia is a multidimensional phenomenon with detrimental effects on patients’ illness course, therapy compliance and quality of life. We aimed at investigating anosognosia for cognitive and behavioral symptoms in Parkinson's Disease (PD) with dementia (PDD) and, for the first time, in PD with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI-PD). Methods: Community dwelling subjects (47 mild PDD, 136 multidomain MCI-PD (mdMCI-PD), 5 single domain MCI-PD (sdMCI-PD), and 197 PD without cognitive impairment (noCI-PD) were enrolled in a cross-sectional design study. All the subjects were administered the Anosognosia Questionnaire for Dementia, the Mental Deterioration Battery and a number of neuropsychiatric inventories. Results: A diagnosis of anosognosia was made in 36% of patients with mild PDD and 16% with mdMCI-PD, whether it was negligible in sdMCI-PD and noCI-PD. Higher severity of anosognosia for cognitive impairment was also found in PDD and in mdMCI-PD. SdMCI-PD had the lower severity of anosognosia for cognitive impairment. Higher anosognosia for cognitive impairment was associated to lower depression in noCI-PD (r = −0.227, p = 0.0013) and mdMCI-PD (r = −0.266, p = 0.0016), and to reduced hedonic tone in noCI-PD (r = −0.191, p = 0.0071). Greater anosognosia was associated to lower executive performances in PDD (r = 0.424, p = 0.0074). Conclusions: Anosognosia for non-motor symptoms is frequent in PD patients with mild dementia or mdMCI. Results confirm the role of neuropsychiatric characteristics in anosognosia also in PD, the high prevalence of anosognosia in neurodegenerative illnesses and suggest a common pathogenic path for anosognosia in different neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.","Orfei, Maria Donata;Assogna, Francesca;Pellicano, Clelia;Pontieri, Francesco Ernesto;Caltagirone, Carlo;Pierantozzi, Mariangela;Stefani, Alessandro;Spalletta, Gianfranco",57192322263;24528556300;8892791500;7003479146;35228717800;7004208388;7005314660;57201126550
10.1016/j.dadm.2018.08.008,2,"Introduction: There is conflicting evidence whether high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia. Genetic variation in the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) locus is associated with altered HDL-C. We aimed to assess AD risk by genetically predicted HDL-C. Methods: Ten single nucleotide polymorphisms within the CETP locus predicting HDL-C were applied to the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) exome chip stage 1 results in up 16,097 late onset AD cases and 18,077 cognitively normal elderly controls. We performed instrumental variables analysis using inverse variance weighting, weighted median, and MR-Egger. Results: Based on 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms distinctly predicting HDL-C in the CETP locus, we found that HDL-C was not associated with risk of AD (P >.7). Discussion: Our study does not support the role of HDL-C on risk of AD through HDL-C altered by CETP. This study does not rule out other mechanisms by which HDL-C affects risk of AD.","Peloso, Gina M.;van der Lee, Sven J.;Sims, R.;van der Lee, S. J.;Naj, A.

10.1038/ng.3916,593,"We identified rare coding variants associated with Alzheimer's disease in a three-stage case-control study of 85,133 subjects. In stage 1, we genotyped 34,174 samples using a whole-exome microarray. In stage 2, we tested associated variants (P < 1 × 10 '4) in 35,962 independent samples using de novo genotyping and imputed genotypes. In stage 3, we used an additional 14,997 samples to test the most significant stage 2 associations (P < 5 × 10 '8) using imputed genotypes. We observed three new genome-wide significant nonsynonymous variants associated with Alzheimer's disease: a protective variant in PLCG2 (rs74905: p.Pro522Arg, P = 5.38 × 10 '10, odds ratio (OR) = 0.68, minor allele frequency (MAF) cases = 0.0059, MAF controls = 0.0093), a risk variant in ABI3 (rs616338: p.Ser209Phe, P = 4.56 × 10 '10, OR = 1.43, MAF cases = 0.011, MAF controls = 0.008), and a new genome-wide significant variant in TREM2 (rs143332484: p.Arg62His, P = 1.55 × 10 '14, OR = 1.67, MAF cases = 0.0143, MAF controls = 0.0089), a known susceptibility gene for Alzheimer's disease. These protein-altering changes are in genes highly expressed in microglia and highlight an immune-related protein-protein interaction network enriched for previously identified risk genes in Alzheimer's disease. These genetic findings provide additional evidence that the microglia-mediated innate immune response contributes directly to the development of Alzheimer's disease.","Sims, Rebecca;Van Der Lee, Sven J.;Naj, Adam C.;Bellenguez, Céline;Badarinarayan, Nandini;Jakobsdottir, Johanna;Kunkle, Brian W.;Boland, Anne;Raybould, Rachel;Bis, Joshua C.;Martin, Eden R.;Grenier-Boley, Benjamin;Heilmann-Heimbach, Stefanie;Chouraki, Vincent;Kuzma, Amanda B.;Sleegers, Kristel;Vronskaya, Maria;Ruiz, Agustin;Graham, Robert R.;Olaso, Robert;Hoffmann, Per;Grove, Megan L.;Vardarajan, Badri N.;Hiltunen, Mikko;Nöthen, Markus M.;White, Charles C.;Hamilton-Nelson, Kara L.;Epelbaum, Jacques;Maier, Wolfgang;Choi, Seung Hoan;Beecham, Gary W.;Dulary, Cécile;Herms, Stefan;Smith, Albert V.;Funk, Cory C.;Derbois, Céline;Forstner, Andreas J.;Ahmad, Shahzad;Li, Hongdong;Bacq, Delphine;Harold, Denise;Satizabal, Claudia L.;Valladares, Otto;Squassina, Alessio;Thomas, Rhodri;Brody, Jennifer A.;Qu, Liming;Sánchez-Juan, Pascual;Morgan, Taniesha;Wolters, Frank J.;Zhao, Yi;Garcia, Florentino Sanchez;Denning, Nicola;Fornage, Myriam;Malamon, John;Naranjo, Maria Candida Deniz;Majounie, Elisa;Mosley, Thomas H.;Dombroski, Beth;Wallon, David;Lupton, Michelle K.;Dupuis, Josée;Whitehead, Patrice;Fratiglioni, Laura;Medway, Christopher;Jian, Xueqiu;Mukherjee, Shubhabrata;Keller, Lina;Brown, Kristelle;Lin, Honghuang;Cantwell, Laura B.;Panza, Francesco;McGuinness, Bernadette;Moreno-Grau, Sonia;Burgess, Jeremy D.;Solfrizzi, Vincenzo;Proitsi, Petra;Adams, Hieab H.;Allen, Mariet;Seripa, Davide;Pastor, Pau;Cupples, L.

In order to do this, 45 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and 45 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects (HC) were administered the Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS), along with neuropsychological, clinical and psychopathological assessment, and underwent an MRI investigation. Hippocampal segmentation was carried out. Regression analyses were performed for BCIS indexes, volumetric parameters of hippocampal subfields and clinical and neuropsychological variables. Results highlighted that in the schizophrenia group, higher levels of SC were related to reduced volume of the left presubiculum, and worse episodic memory. No significant relationship emerged for the SR index. There was no significant relationship between any of the BCIS indexes and volumetric data of the hippocampal subfields in the HC group. Our data support the hypothesis that unrealistic self-overconfidence in schizophrenia is related to the hippocampal presubiculum atrophy, which is involved in episodic memory and cognitive control and is supposed to be underpinned by difficulty in integrating new memories and thus in generating new hypotheses about the self.","Orfei, Maria Donata;Piras, Fabrizio;Banaj, Nerisa;Di Lorenzo, Giorgio;Siracusano, Alberto;Caltagirone, Carlo;Bandinelli, Pier Luca;Ducci, Giuseppe;Spalletta, Gianfranco",57192322263;55274309000;56194289200;8967206900;7006810467;35228717800;6506891293;6505843270;7004157010

10.1038/s41598-023-34998-9,0,"Narratives are paradigmatic examples of natural language, where nouns represent a proxy of information. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies revealed the recruitment of temporal cortices during noun processing and the existence of a noun-specific network at rest. Yet, it is unclear whether, in narratives, changes in noun density influence the brain functional connectivity, so that the coupling between regions correlates with information load. We acquired fMRI activity in healthy individuals listening to a narrative with noun density changing over time and measured whole-network and node-specific degree and betweenness centrality. Network measures were correlated with information magnitude with a time-varying approach. Noun density correlated positively with the across-regions average number of connections and negatively with the average betweenness centrality, suggesting the pruning of peripheral connections as information decreased. Locally, the degree of the bilateral anterior superior temporal sulcus (aSTS) was positively associated with nouns. Importantly, aSTS connectivity cannot be explained by changes in other parts of speech (e.g., verbs) or syllable density. Our results indicate that the brain recalibrates its global connectivity as a function of the information conveyed by nouns in natural language. Also, using naturalistic stimulation and network metrics, we corroborate the role of aSTS in noun processing.","Mastrandrea, Rossana;Cecchetti, Luca;Lettieri, Giada;Handjaras, Giacomo;Leo, Andrea;Papale, Paolo;Gili, Tommaso;Martini, Nicola;Latta, Daniele Della;Chiappino, Dante;Pietrini, Pietro;Ricciardi, Emiliano",56150284600;56625136900;56680972900;35748302500;55311312500;57190440455;13310221100;23025355600;6507141723;8446507300;7005057128;8565770200

The ‘Train the Brain’ programme is a combined motor and cognitive intervention previously shown to markedly improve cognitive functions in MCI individuals compared to non-trained MCI controls, as assessed at the end of the 7-month intervention. Here, we extended the previous analyses to include the long-term effects of the intervention and performed a data disaggregation by gender, education and age of the enrolled participants. We report that the beneficial impact on cognitive functions was preserved at the 14-month follow-up, with greater effects in low-educated compared to high-educated individuals, and in women than in men.","Sale, Alessandro;Noale, Marianna;Cintoli, Simona;Tognoni, Gloria;Braschi, Chiara;Berardi, Nicoletta;Maggi, Stefania;Maffei, Lamberto;Maffei, L.;Picano, E.;Andreassi, M.

10.1038/s41562-022-01507-3,3,"The processing of multisensory information is based upon the capacity of brain regions, such as the superior temporal cortex, to combine information across modalities. However, it is still unclear whether the representation of coherent auditory and visual events requires any prior audiovisual experience to develop and function. Here we measured brain synchronization during the presentation of an audiovisual, audio-only or video-only version of the same narrative in distinct groups of sensory-deprived (congenitally blind and deaf) and typically developed individuals. Intersubject correlation analysis revealed that the superior temporal cortex was synchronized across auditory and visual conditions, even in sensory-deprived individuals who lack any audiovisual experience. This synchronization was primarily mediated by low-level perceptual features, and relied on a similar modality-independent topographical organization of slow temporal dynamics. The human superior temporal cortex is naturally endowed with a functional scaffolding to yield a common representation across multisensory events.","Setti, Francesca;Handjaras, Giacomo;Bottari, Davide;Leo, Andrea;Diano, Matteo;Bruno, Valentina;Tinti, Carla;Cecchetti, Luca;Garbarini, Francesca;Pietrini, Pietro;Ricciardi, Emiliano",57348732900;35748302500;24365931900;55311312500;55736418000;57194764008;7003386397;56625136900;6504829019;7005057128;8565770200
10.1007/s42761-023-00219-9,0,"A wealth of literature suggests the existence of sex differences in how emotions are experienced, recognized, expressed, and regulated. However, to what extent these differences result from the put in place of stereotypes and social rules is still a matter of debate. Literature is an essential cultural institution, a transposition of the social life of people but also of their intimate affective experiences, which can serve to address questions of psychological relevance. Here, we created a large corpus of literary fiction enriched by authors’ metadata to measure the extent to which culture influences how men and women write about emotion. Our results show that even though before the twenty-first century and across 116 countries women more than men have written about affect, starting from 2000, this difference has diminished substantially. Also, in the past, women’s narratives were more positively laden and less arousing. While the difference in arousal is ubiquitous and still present nowadays, sex differences in valence vary as a function of culture and have dissolved in recent years. Altogether, these findings suggest that historic evolution is associated with men and women writing similarly about emotions and reveal a sizable impact of culture on the affective characteristics of the lexicon.","Lettieri, Giada;Handjaras, Giacomo;Bucci, Erika;Pietrini, Pietro;Cecchetti, Luca",56680972900;35748302500;58561797100;7005057128;56625136900
10.1080/02699931.2022.2139661,0,"Vocal bursts are non-linguistic affectively-laden sounds with a crucial function in human communication, yet their affective structure is still debated. Studies showed that ratings of valence and arousal follow a V-shaped relationship in several kinds of stimuli: high arousal ratings are more likely to go on a par with very negative or very positive valence. Across two studies, we asked participants to listen to 1,008 vocal bursts and judge both how they felt when listening to the sound (i.e. core affect condition), and how the speaker felt when producing it (i.e. perception of affective quality condition). We show that a V-shaped fit outperforms a linear model in explaining the valence-arousal relationship across conditions and studies, even after equating the number of exemplars across emotion categories. Also, although subjective experience can be significantly predicted using affective quality ratings, core affect scores are significantly lower in arousal, less extreme in valence, more variable between individuals, and less reproducible between studies. Nonetheless, stimuli rated with opposite valence between conditions range from 11% (study 1) to 17% (study 2). Lastly, we demonstrate that ambiguity in valence (i.e. high between-participants variability) explains violations of the V-shape and relates to higher arousal.","Grollero, Demetrio;Petrolini, Valentina;Viola, Marco;Morese, Rosalba;Lettieri, Giada;Cecchetti, Luca",57211684589;56678579600;57193347628;55216533000;56680972900;56625136900
10.1093/scan/nsab112,5,"In everyday life, the stream of affect results from the interaction between past experiences, expectations and the unfolding of events. How the brain represents the relationship between time and affect has been hardly explored, as it requires modeling the complexity of everyday life in the laboratory setting. Movies condense into hours a multitude of emotional responses, synchronized across subjects and characterized by temporal dynamics alike real-world experiences. Here, we use time-varying intersubject brain synchronization and real-time behavioral reports to test whether connectivity dynamics track changes in affect during movie watching. The results show that polarity and intensity of experiences relate to the connectivity of the default mode and control networks and converge in the right temporoparietal cortex. We validate these results in two experiments including four independent samples, two movies and alternative analysis workflows. Finally, we reveal chronotopic connectivity maps within the temporoparietal and prefrontal cortex, where adjacent areas preferentially encode affect at specific timescales.","Lettieri, Giada;Handjaras, Giacomo;Setti, Francesca;Cappello, Elisa Morgana;Bruno, Valentina;Diano, Matteo;Leo, Andrea;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Pietrini, Pietro;Cecchetti, Luca",56680972900;35748302500;57348732900;57348734100;57194764008;55736418000;55311312500;8565770200;7005057128;56625136900
10.3389/fpsyg.2022.798871,0,"Humans naturally perceive visual patterns in a global manner and are remarkably capable of extracting object shapes based on properties such as proximity, closure, symmetry, and good continuation. Notwithstanding the role of these properties in perceptual grouping, studies highlighted differences in disembedding performance across individuals, which are summarized by the field dependence dimension. Evidence suggests that age and educational attainment explain part of this variability, whereas the role of sex is still highly debated. Also, which stimulus features primarily influence inter-individual variations in perceptual grouping has still to be fully determined. Building upon these premises, we assessed the role of age, education level, and sex on performance at the Leuven Embedded Figure Test—a proxy of disembedding abilities—in 391 cisgender individuals. We also investigated to what extent shape symmetry, closure, complexity, and continuation relate to task accuracy. Overall, target asymmetry, closure, and good continuation with the embedding context increase task difficulty. Simpler shapes are more difficult to detect than those with more lines, yet context complexity impairs the recognition of complex targets (i.e., those with 6 lines or more) to a greater extent. Concerning demographic data, we confirm that age and educational attainment are significantly associated with disembedding abilities and reveal a perceptual advantage in males. In summary, our study further highlights the role of shape properties in disembedding performance and unveils sex differences not reported so far.","Cappello, Elisa Morgana;Lettieri, Giada;Malizia, Andrea Patricelli;d’Arcangelo, Sonia;Handjaras, Giacomo;Lattanzi, Nicola;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Cecchetti, Luca",57348734100;56680972900;16028897900;57463509700;35748302500;56136055200;8565770200;56625136900
10.1109/MetroXRAINE54828.2022.9967695,0,"Personality influences human behaviour during social interactions as well as is influenced by the situation in which these interactions take place. To date, the reciprocal interplay between personality and the situation is still little investigated in modelling personality for social robots, even if the personality psychology field has widely recognised this interplay. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel personality model for social robots based on the formalisation of the Cognitive-Affective Processing System theory of personality. According to this theory, we conceived a personality model as a system that interacts with features of the situation to generate the behaviour. We focus on a bottom-up approach by detailing the core components of the system and by posing particular emphasis on its link with induced emotions. Furthermore, we preliminary implemented the proposed personality model taking advantage of the flexibility offered by expert systems and endowing the personality model with some degree of explainability.Our work approaches social robot personality focusing on increasing the human-likeness of the model, rather than improving the imitation of human behaviours, to improve the believability and the user experience of social human-robot interactions.","Gargano, Andrea;Cominelli, Lorenzo;Vannucci, Caterina;Cecchetti, Luca;Scilingo, Enzo Pasquale",57887940500;56303460500;57934135100;56625136900;6601971636
10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118574,0,"Functional Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (fQSM) allows for the quantitative measurement of time-varying magnetic susceptibility across cortical and subcortical brain structures with a potentially higher spatial specificity than conventional fMRI. While the usefulness of fQSM with General Linear Model and “On/Off” paradigms has been assessed, little is known about the potential applications and limitations of this technique in more sophisticated experimental paradigms and analyses, such as those currently used in modern neuroimaging. To thoroughly characterize fQSM activations, here we used 7T MRI, tonotopic mapping, as well as univariate (i.e., GLM and population Receptive Field) and multivariate (Representational Similarity Analysis; RSA) analyses. Although fQSM detected less tone-responsive voxels than fMRI, they were more consistently localized in gray matter. Also, the majority of active gray matter voxels exhibited negative fQSM response, signaling the expected oxyhemoglobin increase, whereas positive fQSM activations were mainly in white matter. Though fMRI- and fQSM-based tonotopic maps were overall comparable, the representation of frequency tunings in tone-sensitive regions was significantly more balanced for fQSM. Lastly, RSA revealed that frequency information from the auditory cortex could be successfully retrieved by using either methods. Overall, fQSM produces complementary results to conventional fMRI, as it captures small-scale variations in the activation pattern which inform multivariate measures. Although positive fQSM responses deserve further investigation, they do not impair the interpretation of contrasts of interest. The quantitative nature of fQSM, its spatial specificity and the possibility to simultaneously acquire canonical fMRI support the use of this technique for longitudinal and multicentric studies and pre-surgical mapping.","Lancione, Marta;Costagli, Mauro;Handjaras, Giacomo;Tosetti, Michela;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Pietrini, Pietro;Cecchetti, Luca",57195628629;22333629800;35748302500;6701756843;8565770200;7005057128;56625136900
10.1162/jocn_a_01753,7,"Emotion self-regulation relies both on cognitive and behavioral strategies implemented to modulate the subjective experience and/or the behavioral expression of a given emotion. Although it is known that a network encompassing fronto-cingulate and parietal brain areas is engaged during successful emotion regulation, the functional mechanisms underlying failures in emotion suppression (ES) are still unclear. In order to investigate this issue, we analyzed video and high-density EEG recordings of 20 healthy adult participants during an ES and a free expression task performed on two consecutive days. Changes in facial expression during ES, but not free expression, were preceded by local increases in sleep-like activity (1–4 Hz) in brain areas responsible for emotional suppression, including bilateral anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex, and in right middle/inferior frontal gyrus ( p < .05, corrected). Moreover, shorter sleep duration the night before the ES experiment correlated with the number of behavioral errors ( p = .03) and tended to be associated with higher frontal sleep-like activity during ES failures ( p = .09). These results indicate that local sleep-like activity may represent the cause of ES failures in humans and may offer a functional explanation for previous observations linking lack of sleep, changes in frontal activity, and emotional dysregulation.","Avvenuti, Giulia;Bertelloni, Davide;Lettieri, Giada;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Cecchetti, Luca;Pietrini, Pietro;Bernardi, Giulio",57188638994;57221353204;56680972900;8565770200;56625136900;7005057128;54988409300
10.1007/s40520-019-01280-w,15,"Background and aims: Cognitive impairments associated with aging and dementia are major sources of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPs) and deterioration in quality of life (QoL). Preventive measures to both reduce disease and improve QoL in those affected are increasingly targeting individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at early disease stage. However, NPs and QoL outcomes are too commonly overlooked in intervention trials. The purpose of this study was to test the effects of physical and cognitive training on NPs and QoL in MCI. Methods: Baseline data from an MCI court (N = 93, mean age 74.9 ± 4.7) enrolled in the Train the Brain (TtB) study were collected. Subjects were randomized in two groups: a group participated to a cognitive and physical training program, while the other sticked to usual standard care. Both groups underwent a follow-up re-evaluation after 7 months from baseline. NPs were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and QoL was assessed using Quality of Life-Alzheimer’s Disease (QOL-AD) scale. Results: After 7 months of training, training group exhibited a significant reduction of NPs and a significant increase in QOL-AD with respect to no-training group (p = 0.0155, p = 0.0013, respectively). Our preliminary results suggest that a combined training can reduce NPs and improve QoL. Conclusions: Measuring QoL outcomes is a potentially important factor in ensuring that a person with cognitive deficits can ‘live well’ with pathology. Future data from non-pharmacological interventions, with a larger sample and a longer follow-up period, could confirm the results and the possible implications for such prevention strategies for early cognitive decline.","Cintoli, Simona;Radicchi, Claudia;Noale, Marianna;Maggi, Stefania;Meucci, Giuseppe;Tognoni, Gloria;Bonuccelli, Ubaldo;Sale, Alessandro;Berardi, Nicoletta;Maffei, Lamberto;Picano, E.;Andreassi, M.

10.1111/ejn.14954,14,"In neuroimaging studies, small sample sizes and the resultant reduced statistical power to detect effects that are not large, combined with inadequate analytic choices, concur to produce inflated or false-positive findings. To mitigate these issues, researchers often restrict analyses to specific brain areas, using the region of interest (ROI) approach. Crucially, ROI analysis assumes the a priori justified definition of the target region. Nonetheless, reports often lack details about where in the timeline, ranging from study conception to the data analysis and interpretation of findings, were ROIs selected. Frequently, the rationale for ROI selection is vague or inadequately founded on the existing literature. These shortcomings have important implications for ROI-based studies, augmenting the risk that observed effects are inflated or even false positives. Tools like preregistration and registered reports could address this problem, ensuring the validity of ROI-based studies. The benefits could be enhanced by additional practices such as selection of ROIs using quantitative methods (i.e., meta-analysis) and the sharing of whole-brain unthresholded maps of effect size, as well as of binary ROIs, in publicly accessible repositories.","Gentili, Claudio;Cecchetti, Luca;Handjaras, Giacomo;Lettieri, Giada;Cristea, Ioana A.",13204290200;56625136900;35748302500;56680972900;25642340700
10.1152/jn.00212.2020,4,"Object recognition relies on different transformations of the retinal input, carried out by the visual system, that range from local contrast to object shape and category. While some of those transformations are thought to occur at specific stages of the visual hierarchy, the features they represent are correlated (e.g., object shape and identity) and selectivity for the same feature overlaps in many brain regions. This may be explained either by collinearity across representations or may instead reflect the coding of multiple dimensions by the same cortical population. Moreover, orthogonal and shared components may differently impact distinctive stages of the visual hierarchy. We recorded functional MRI activity while participants passively attended to object images and employed a statistical approach that partitioned orthogonal and shared object representations to reveal their relative impact on brain processing. Orthogonal shape representations (silhouette, curvature, and medial axis) independently explained distinct and overlapping clusters of selectivity in the occitotemporal and parietal cortex. Moreover, we show that the relevance of shared representations linearly increases moving from posterior to anterior regions. These results indicate that the visual cortex encodes shared relations between different features in a topographic fashion and that object shape is encoded along different dimensions, each representing orthogonal features.","Papale, Paolo;Leo, Andrea;Handjaras, Giacomo;Cecchetti, Luca;Pietrini, Pietro;Ricciardi, Emiliano",57190440455;55311312500;35748302500;56625136900;7005057128;8565770200

10.1038/s41586-020-2314-9,436,"Data analysis workflows in many scientific domains have become increasingly complex and flexible. Here we assess the effect of this flexibility on the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging by asking 70 independent teams to analyse the same dataset, testing the same 9 ex-ante hypotheses1. The flexibility of analytical approaches is exemplified by the fact that no two teams chose identical workflows to analyse the data. This flexibility resulted in sizeable variation in the results of hypothesis tests, even for teams whose statistical maps were highly correlated at intermediate stages of the analysis pipeline. Variation in reported results was related to several aspects of analysis methodology. Notably, a meta-analytical approach that aggregated information across teams yielded a significant consensus in activated regions. Furthermore, prediction markets of researchers in the field revealed an overestimation of the likelihood of significant findings, even by researchers with direct knowledge of the dataset2–5. Our findings show that analytical flexibility can have substantial effects on scientific conclusions, and identify factors that may be related to variability in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results emphasize the importance of validating and sharing complex analysis workflows, and demonstrate the need for performing and reporting multiple analyses of the same data. Potential approaches that could be used to mitigate issues related to analytical variability are discussed.","Botvinik-Nezer, Rotem;Holzmeister, Felix;Camerer, Colin F.;Dreber, Anna;Huber, Juergen;Johannesson, Magnus;Kirchler, Michael;Iwanir, Roni;Mumford, Jeanette A.;Adcock, R.

10.1016/j.bandc.2020.105517,12,"Transcendental Meditation (TM) is defined as a mental process of transcending using a silent mantra. Previous work showed that relatively brief period of TM practice leads to decreases in stress and anxiety. However, whether these changes are subserved by specific morpho-functional brain modifications (as observed in other meditation techniques) is still unclear. Using a longitudinal design, we combined psychometric questionnaires, structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) to investigate the potential brain modifications underlying the psychological effects of TM. The final sample included 19 naïve subjects instructed to complete two daily 20-min TM sessions, and 15 volunteers in the control group. Both groups were evaluated at recruitment (T0) and after 3 months (T1). At T1, only meditators showed a decrease in perceived anxiety and stress (t(18) = 2.53, p = 0.02), which correlated negatively with T1-T0 changes in functional connectivity among posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus and left superior parietal lobule. Additionally, TM practice was associated with increased connectivity between PCC and right insula, likely reflecting changes in interoceptive awareness. No structural changes were observed in meditators or control subjects. These preliminary findings indicate that beneficial effects of TM may be mediated by functional brain changes that take place after a short practice period of 3 months.","Avvenuti, Giulia;Leo, Andrea;Cecchetti, Luca;Franco, Maria Fatima;Travis, Frederick;Caramella, Davide;Bernardi, Giulio;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Pietrini, Pietro",57188638994;55311312500;56625136900;57213354080;7003786105;7006901509;54988409300;8565770200;7005057128

However, which mechanisms link descriptions of affective states to brain activity is unclear, with evidence supporting either local or distributed processing. A biologically favorable alternative is provided by the notion of gradient, which postulates the isomorphism between functional representations of stimulus features and cortical distance. Here, we use fMRI activity evoked by an emotionally charged movie and continuous ratings of the perceived emotion intensity to reveal the topographic organization of affective states. Results show that three orthogonal and spatially overlapping gradients encode the polarity, complexity and intensity of emotional experiences in right temporo-parietal territories. The spatial arrangement of these gradients allows the brain to map a variety of affective states within a single patch of cortex. As this organization resembles how sensory regions represent psychophysical properties (e.g., retinotopy), we propose emotionotopy as a principle of emotion coding.","Lettieri, Giada;Handjaras, Giacomo;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Leo, Andrea;Papale, Paolo;Betta, Monica;Pietrini, Pietro;Cecchetti, Luca",56680972900;35748302500;8565770200;55311312500;57190440455;55904308300;7005057128;56625136900

Interestingly, both methods have been shown to detect relative alterations of brain functional connectivity in conditions associated with changes in the level of consciousness, such as following severe brain injury or under anaesthesia. Despite these promising findings, it was unclear whether wPLI and wSMI may account for distinct or similar types of functional interactions. Using simulated high-density (hd-)EEG data, we demonstrate that, while wPLI has high sensitivity for couplings presenting a mixture of linear and nonlinear interdependencies, only wSMI can detect purely nonlinear interaction dynamics. Moreover, we evaluated the potential impact of these differences on real experimental data by computing wPLI and wSMI connectivity in hd-EEG recordings of 12 healthy adults during wakefulness and deep (N3-)sleep, characterised by different levels of consciousness. In line with the simulation-based findings, this analysis revealed that both methods have different sensitivity for changes in brain connectivity across the two vigilance states.

Relevant features span from simple low-level properties, as contrast and spatial frequencies, to object-based attributes, as shape and category. However, how these features are integrated into coherent percepts is still debated. Moreover, these dimensions often share common biases: for instance, stimuli from the same category (e.g., tools) may have similar shapes. Here, using magnetoencephalography, we revealed the temporal dynamics of feature processing in human subjects attending to objects from six semantic categories. By employing Relative Weights Analysis, we mitigated collinearity between model-based descriptions of stimuli and showed that low-level properties (contrast and spatial frequencies), shape (medial-axis) and category are represented within the same spatial locations early in time: 100–150 ms after stimulus onset. This fast and overlapping processing may result from independent parallel computations, with categorical representation emerging later than the onset of low-level feature processing, yet before shape coding. Categorical information is represented both before and after shape, suggesting a role for this feature in the refinement of categorical matching.","Papale, Paolo;Betta, Monica;Handjaras, Giacomo;Malfatti, Giulia;Cecchetti, Luca;Rampinini, Alessandra;Pietrini, Pietro;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Turella, Luca;Leo, Andrea",57190440455;55904308300;35748302500;57208881629;56625136900;57190443337;7005057128;8565770200;15520235500;55311312500

Recent studies have suggested that lesion of white-matter pathways plays an important role in producing spatial neglect by causing a widespread functional breakdown of the network of cortical and subcortical structures that regulates orienting of spatial attention. Nonetheless, this conclusion is largely based on the study of patients who suffer combined grey and white matter damage and should be better corroborated by the study of cases with selective or predominant white matter dysfunction. Here, we describe the clinical and MRI follow-up of a patient who suffered left spatial neglect due to inflammatory Acute Disseminated Encephalo-Myelitis (ADEM)that affected the white matter. Recovery from neglect was matched with recovery from inflammatory white-matter dysfunction, despite a concomitant and progressive increase in cortical atrophy and ventricular dilatation.

Here, the response of the auditory cortex to the presentation of short acoustic stimuli has been studied with fQSM. fQSM responses to stimuli were obtained by using a data-driven approach based on signal deconvolution to avoid assumptions regarding the response shape. fQSM and BOLD responses showed similar shapes, however, while the majority (82%) of fQSM responses described transient decreases in magnetic susceptibility (explainable by the same mechanisms behind the typical, positive BOLD responses), some voxels exhibited transient increments in magnetic susceptibility, which might reflect the interplay among changes in fractional oxygen saturation, cerebral blood flow, and volume. Statistically significant fQSM responses were observed not only in veins (which constitute the largest sources of magnetic susceptibility contrast) but also in gray matter tissue, suggesting that this technique is sensitive to subtle, stimulus-dependent changes also in the parenchyma, and therefore it might be useful to localize and interpret the sources of activation.","Costagli, Mauro;Lancione, Marta;Cecchetti, Luca;Pietrini, Pietro;Cosottini, Mirco;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Tosetti, Michela",22333629800;57195628629;56625136900;7005057128;55999935600;8565770200;6701756843
10.1002/hbm.24492,28,"About 90% of fMRI findings on specific phobias (SP) include analysis of region of interest (ROI). This approach characterized by higher sensitivity may produce inflated results, particularly when findings are aggregated in meta-analytic maps. Here, we conducted a systematic review and activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on SP, testing the impact of the inclusion of ROI-based studies. ALE meta-analyses were carried out either including ROI-based results or focusing on whole-brain voxelwise studies exclusively. To assess the risk of bias in the neuroimaging field, we modified the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) and measured the reliability of fMRI findings. Of the 31 selected investigations (564 patients and 485 controls) one-third did not motivate ROI selection: five studies did not report an explicit rationale, whereas four did not cite any specific reference in this regard. Analyses including ROI-based studies revealed differences between phobics and healthy subjects in several regions of the limbic circuit. However, when focusing on whole-brain analysis, only the anterior midcingulate cortex differentiated SP from controls. Notably, 13 studies were labeled with low risk of bias according to the adapted NOS. The inclusion of ROI-based results artificially inflates group differences in fMRI meta-analyses. Moreover, a priori, well-motivated selection of ROIs is desirable to improve quality and reproducibility in SP neuroimaging studies. Lastly, the use of modified NOS may represent a valuable way to assess and evaluate biases in fMRI studies: “low risk” of bias was reported for less than half of the included studies, indicating the need for better practices in fMRI.","Gentili, Claudio;Messerotti Benvenuti, Simone;Lettieri, Giada;Costa, Cristiano;Cecchetti, Luca",13204290200;36835220800;56680972900;57205059473;56625136900

With modern literature arguing against unique roles for these cortical regions, different theories have favored either neural code-sharing or cortical space-sharing, thus trying to explain the intertwined spatial and functional organization of motor and acoustic components across the fronto-temporal cortical network. In this context, the focus of attention has recently shifted toward specific model fitting, aimed at motor and/or acoustic space reconstruction in brain activity within the language network. Here, we tested a model based on acoustic properties (formants), and one based on motor properties (articulation parameters), where model-free decoding of evoked fMRI activity during perception, imagery, and production of vowels had been successful. Results revealed that phonological information organizes around formant structure during the perception of vowels; interestingly, such a model was reconstructed in a broad temporal region, outside of the primary auditory cortex, but also in the pars triangularis of the left inferior frontal gyrus. Conversely, articulatory features were not associated with brain activity in these regions. Overall, our results call for a degree of interdependence based on acoustic information, between the frontal and temporal ends of the language network.","Rampinini, Alessandra Cecilia;Handjaras, Giacomo;Leo, Andrea;Cecchetti, Luca;Betta, Monica;Marotta, Giovanna;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Pietrini, Pietro",57190443337;35748302500;55311312500;56625136900;55904308300;55951413200;8565770200;7005057128

Findings on the association between vitamin-related biochemistry and cognitive abilities suggest that the structural and functional properties of the brain may represent an intermediate biomarker linking vitamin concentrations to cognition. Despite this, no previous study directly investigated whether vitamin B12, folate, and homocysteine levels are sufficient to explain individual neuropsychological profiles or, alternatively, whether the activity of brain regions modulated by these compounds better predicts cognition in elders. Here, we measured the relationship between vitamin blood concentrations, scores at seventeen neuropsychological tests, and brain activity of sixty-five elders spanning from normal to Mild Cognitive Impairment. We then evaluated whether task-related brain responses represent an intermediate phenotype, providing a better prediction of subjects' neuropsychological scores, as compared to the one obtained considering blood biochemistry only. We found that the hemodynamic activity of the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex was positively associated (p value < 0 05 cluster corrected) with vitamin B12 concentrations, suggesting that elders with higher B12 levels had a more pronounced recruitment of this salience network region. Crucially, the activity of this area significantly predicted subjects' visual search and attention abilities (p value = 0 0023), whereas B12 levels per se failed to do so.

AIM: We investigated the relationship between electroencephalography (EEG)-based connectivity, the extent of brain lesions and changes in motor performance after an intensive task-oriented circuit training (TOCT). DESIGN: Observational longitudinal study. SETTING: Outpatients training program. POPULATION: Sixteen MS patients (10F; mean age =51.4 years; range: 27-67; mean disease duration =15.1 years; range: 2-26; mean Expanded Disability Status Scale 4.4; range: 3.5-5.5), were included in our study. METHODS: MS patients with mild gait impairment were evaluated through functional scales and submitted to TOCT. Resting-state EEG was performed before (TO) and after (T1) rehabilitation. Alpha-band weighted Phase Lag Index (WPLI) and broadband weighted Symbolic Mutual Information (WSMI) connectivity analyses were performed. White matter lesion load was measured using MRI prior to the TOCT. Neurophysiological and structural parameters were then related to behavioral changes. RESULTS: Dynamic Gait Index significantly improved after TOCT (F(1.14) =13.10, P=0.003). Moreover, the interaction between TOCT and age was observed for changes in Timed Up and Go (TUG) performance (F(1.14) = 7.75, P=0.015), indicating that older patients only benefited in this measure. Regarding the relationship between EEG connectivity and TOCT outcome, we observed positive correlations between changes in TUG and strength (P=0.017) and efficiency (Pone-tail =0.029) of alpha-band WPLI connectivity at T0. Such correlation was mainly driven by anteroposterior regional interactions (P=0.038), rather than by inter-hemispheric connectivity (P=0.089). Moreover, we observed a positive correlation between performance improvements and WSMI connectivity at T1 (P=0.001) as well as the difference between T0 and T1 (P=0.005). Lesion load percentage was not related to functional improvement after TOCT (Pone-tail=0.137). CONCLUSIONS: Results of the current study demonstrated that baseline alpha-band WPLI connectivity predicts TOCT outcome in MS patients. Moreover, broadband WSMI tracks neural changes that accompany treatment-related variations in motor performance. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Our findings suggest that EEG-based connectivity measures may represent a potential tool for customizing rehabilitative management of the disease.","Tramonti, Caterina;Imperatori, Laura S.;Fanciullacci, Chiara;Lamola, Giuseppe;Lettieri, Giada;Bernardi, Giulio;Cecchetti, Luca;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Chisari, Carmelo",57128438700;57209394751;6505491076;55388614800;56680972900;54988409300;56625136900;8565770200;6506235336
10.1093/cercor/bhy134,16,"Anatomo-clinical evidence from motor-awareness disorders after brain-damages suggests that the premotor cortex (PMC) is involved in motor-monitoring of voluntary actions. Indeed, PMC lesions prevent patients from detecting the mismatch between intended, but not executed, movements with the paralyzed limb. This functional magnetic resonance imaging study compared, in healthy subjects, free movements against blocked movements, precluded by a cast. Cast-related corticospinal excitability changes were investigated by using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Immediately after the immobilization, when the cast prevented the execution of left-hand movements, the contralateral right (ventral) vPMC showed both increased hemodynamic activity and increased functional connectivity with the hand area in the right somatosensory cortex, suggesting a vPMC involvement in detecting the mismatch between planned and executed movements. Crucially, after 1 week of immobilization, when the motor system had likely learned that no movement could be executed and, therefore, predictions about motor consequences were changed, vPMC did not show the enhanced activity as if no incongruence has to be detected. This can be interpreted as a consequence of the plastic changes induced by long-lasting immobilization, as also proved by the cast-related corticospinal excitability modulation in our subjects. The present findings highlight the crucial role of vPMC in the anatomo-functional network generating the human motor-awareness.","Garbarini, Francesca;Cecchetti, Luca;Bruno, Valentina;Mastropasqua, Angela;Fossataro, Carlotta;Massazza, Giuseppe;Sacco, Katiuscia;Valentini, Maria Consuelo;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Berti, Anna",6504829019;56625136900;57194764008;57188565802;55763944000;15029993300;34267607900;35611359500;8565770200;7005212707

Previous neuroimaging studies have highlighted that voluntary retrieval processes from AM involve different forms of memory and cognitive functions. Thus, a complex and widespread brain functional network has been found to support AM. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study used a multivariate approach to determine whether neural activity within the AM circuit would recognize memories of real autobiographical events, and to evaluate individual differences in the recruitment of this network. Fourteen right-handed females took part in the study. During scanning, subjects were presented with sentences representing a detail of a highly emotional real event (positive or negative) and were asked to indicate whether the sentence described something that had or had not really happened to them. Group analysis showed a set of cortical areas able to discriminate the truthfulness of the recalled events: medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex, precuneus, bilateral angular, superior frontal gyri, and early visual cortical areas. Single-subject results showed that the decoding occurred at different time points. No differences were found between recalling a positive or a negative event. Our results show that the entire AM network is engaged in monitoring the veracity of AMs. This process is not affected by the emotional valence of the experience but rather by individual differences in cognitive strategies used to retrieve AMs.","Benuzzi, Francesca;Ballotta, Daniela;Handjaras, Giacomo;Leo, Andrea;Papale, Paolo;Zucchelli, Michaela;Molinari, Maria Angela;Lui, Fausta;Cecchetti, Luca;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Sartori, Giuseppe;Pietrini, Pietro;Nichelli, Paolo Frigio",6602925063;56539993300;35748302500;55311312500;57190440455;56835384100;17534899400;7003908108;56625136900;8565770200;7007044463;7005057128;7005740633
10.1523/ENEURO.0075-18.2018,11,"One of the major challenges in visual neuroscience is represented by foreground-background segmentation. Data from nonhuman primates show that segmentation leads to two distinct, but associated processes: the enhancement of neural activity during figure processing (i.e., foreground enhancement) and the suppression of background-related activity (i.e., background suppression). To study foreground-background segmentation in ecological conditions, we introduce a novel method based on parametric modulation of low-level image properties followed by application of simple computational image-processing models. By correlating the outcome of this procedure with human fMRI activity, measured during passive viewing of 334 natural images, we produced easily interpretable “correlation images” from visual populations. Results show evidence of foreground enhancement in all tested regions, from V1 to lateral occipital complex (LOC), while background suppression occurs in V4 and LOC only. Correlation images derived from V4 and LOC revealed a preserved spatial resolution of foreground textures, indicating a richer representation of the salient part of natural images, rather than a simplistic model of object shape. Our results indicate that scene segmentation occurs during natural viewing, even when individuals are not required to perform any particular task.","Papale, Paolo;Leo, Andrea;Cecchetti, Luca;Handjaras, Giacomo;Kay, Kendrick N.;Pietrini, Pietro;Ricciardi, Emiliano",57190440455;55311312500;56625136900;35748302500;22957898800;7005057128;8565770200

Aim of the study was to assess the effects of a 7-month cognitive, social, and physical training program on cognitive and vascular function in patients with mild cognitive impairment. In a single-center, randomized, parallelgroup study, 113 patients (age, 65-89 years) were randomized to multidomain training (n=55) or usual care (n=58). All participants underwent neuropsychological tests and vascular evaluation, including brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, carotid distensibility, and assessment of circulating hematopoietic CD34+ and endothelial progenitor cells. At study entry, an age-matched control group (n=45) was also studied. Compared with controls, patients had at study entry a reduced flow-mediated dilation (2.97±2.14% versus 3.73±2.06%; P=0.03) and hyperemic stimulus (shear rate area under the curve, 19.1±15.7 versus 25.7±15.1×10-3; P=0.009); only the latter remained significant after adjustment for confounders (P=0.03).

The only clinical predictor of improvement of cognitive function after training was established hypertension. There was no correlation between changes in measures of cognitive and vascular function. In conclusion, a multidomain training program slows cognitive decline, especially in hypertensive individuals. This effect is accompanied by improved systemic endothelial function, mobilization of progenitor CD34+ cells, and preserved carotid distensibility.","Bruno, Rosa Maria;Stea, Francesco;Sicari, Rosa;Ghiadoni, Lorenzo;Taddei, Stefano;Ungar, Andrea;Bonuccelli, Ubaldo;Tognoni, Gloria;Cintoli, Simona;Turco, Serena Del;Sbrana, Silverio;Gargani, Luna;D'Angelo, Gennaro;Pratali, Lorenza;Berardi, Nicoletta;Maffei, Lamberto;Picano, Eugenio;Andreassi, M.

Recent cognitive models ascribed different levels of disembedding task performance to the efficiency of the subtended mental processes engaged during visuo-spatial perception. Here we aimed at assessing whether different levels of the disembedding ability were associated to the functional signatures of neural efficiency, defined as a specific modulation in response magnitude and functional connectivity strength in task-related areas. Consequently, brain activity evoked by a visual task involving the disembedding ability was acquired using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a sample of 23 right-handed healthy individuals. Brain activity was analyzed at different levels of information processing, from local responses to connectivity interactions between brain nodes, as far as to network topological properties. All different levels of information processing were significantly modulated by individual behavioral performance. Specifically, single voxel response magnitude, connectivity strength of the right intrahemispheric and interhemispheric edges, and graph measures (i.e., local and global efficiency) were negatively associated to behavioral performance. Altogether, these results indicate that efficiency during a disembedding task cannot be merely attributed to a reduced neural recruitment of task-specific regions, but can be better characterized as an enhanced functional hemispherical asymmetry.","Danti, Sabrina;Handjaras, Giacomo;Cecchetti, Luca;Beuzeron-Mangina, Helen;Pietrini, Pietro;Ricciardi, Emiliano",56682722100;35748302500;56625136900;35078173400;7005057128;8565770200

Nonetheless, neuropsychological, structural and functional studies have questioned such subdivision, suggesting an interwoven organization of the speech function within these cortices. We tested whether sub-regions within frontal and temporal speech-related areas retain specific phonological representations during both perception and production. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and multivoxel pattern analysis, we showed functional and spatial segregation across the left fronto-temporal cortex during listening, imagery and production of vowels. In accordance with classical models of language and evidence from functional studies, the inferior frontal and superior temporal cortices discriminated among perceived and produced vowels respectively, also engaging in the non-classical, alternative function - i.e. perception in the inferior frontal and production in the superior temporal cortex. Crucially, though, contiguous and non-overlapping sub-regions within these hubs performed either the classical or non-classical function, the latter also representing non-linguistic sounds (i.e., pure tones). Extending previous results and in line with integration theories, our findings not only demonstrate that sensitivity to speech listening exists in production-related regions and vice versa, but they also suggest that the nature of such interwoven organisation is built upon low-level perception.","Rampinini, Alessandra Cecilia;Handjaras, Giacomo;Leo, Andrea;Cecchetti, Luca;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Marotta, Giovanna;Pietrini, Pietro",57190443337;35748302500;55311312500;56625136900;8565770200;55951413200;7005057128
10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.05.001,19,"The organization of semantic information in the brain has been mainly explored through category-based models, on the assumption that categories broadly reflect the organization of conceptual knowledge. However, the analysis of concepts as individual entities, rather than as items belonging to distinct superordinate categories, may represent a significant advancement in the comprehension of how conceptual knowledge is encoded in the human brain. Here, we studied the individual representation of thirty concrete nouns from six different categories, across different sensory modalities (i.e., auditory and visual) and groups (i.e., sighted and congenitally blind individuals) in a core hub of the semantic network, the left angular gyrus, and in its neighboring regions within the lateral parietal cortex. Four models based on either perceptual or semantic features at different levels of complexity (i.e., low- or high-level) were used to predict fMRI brain activity using representational similarity encoding analysis. When controlling for the superordinate component, high-level models based on semantic and shape information led to significant encoding accuracies in the intraparietal sulcus only. This region is involved in feature binding and combination of concepts across multiple sensory modalities, suggesting its role in high-level representation of conceptual knowledge. Moreover, when the information regarding superordinate categories is retained, a large extent of parietal cortex is engaged. This result indicates the need to control for the coarse-level categorial organization when performing studies on higher-level processes related to the retrieval of semantic information.","Handjaras, Giacomo;Leo, Andrea;Cecchetti, Luca;Papale, Paolo;Lenci, Alessandro;Marotta, Giovanna;Pietrini, Pietro;Ricciardi, Emiliano",35748302500;55311312500;56625136900;57190440455;8286541500;55951413200;7005057128;8565770200

10.3389/fnsys.2016.00089,51,"Research in blind individuals has primarily focused for a long time on the brain plastic reorganization that occurs in early visual areas. Only more recently, scientists have developed innovative strategies to understand to what extent vision is truly a mandatory prerequisite for the brain’s fine morphological architecture to develop and function. As a whole, the studies conducted to date in sighted and congenitally blind individuals have provided ample evidence that several ""visual"" cortical areas develop independently from visual experience and do process information content regardless of the sensory modality through which a particular stimulus is conveyed: a property named supramodality. At the same time, lack of vision leads to a structural and functional reorganization within ""visual"" brain areas, a phenomenon known as cross-modal plasticity. Cross-modal recruitment of the occipital cortex in visually deprived individuals represents an adaptative compensatory mechanism that mediates processing of non-visual inputs. Supramodality and cross-modal plasticity appears to be the ""yin and yang"" of brain development: supramodal is what takes place despite the lack of vision, whereas cross-modal is what happens because of lack of vision.

To address the differential role of low-level sensory-based and high-level abstract features in semantic processing, we combined behavioral studies of linguistic production and brain activity measures by functional magnetic resonance imaging in sighted and congenitally blind individuals while they performed a property-generation task with concrete nouns from eight categories, presented through visual and/or auditory modalities.Patterns of neural activity within a large semantic cortical network that comprised parahippocampal, lateral occipital, temporo-parieto-occipital and inferior parietal cortices correlated with linguistic production and were independent both from the modality of stimulus presentation (either visual or auditory) and the (lack of) visual experience. In contrast, selected modality-dependent differences were observed only when the analysis was limited to the individual regions within the semantic cortical network.We conclude that conceptual knowledge in the human brain relies on a distributed, modality-independent cortical representation that integrates the partial category and modality specific information retained at a regional level.","Handjaras, Giacomo;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Leo, Andrea;Lenci, Alessandro;Cecchetti, Luca;Cosottini, Mirco;Marotta, Giovanna;Pietrini, Pietro",35748302500;8565770200;55311312500;8286541500;56625136900;55999935600;55951413200;7005057128
10.1017/S1355617716000485,15,"Objectives: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may be adopted as a complementary tool for bedside observation in the disorders of consciousness (DOC). However, the diagnostic value of this technique is still debated because of the lack of accuracy in determining levels of consciousness within a single patient. Recently, Giacino and colleagues (2014) hypothesized that a longitudinal fMRI evaluation may provide a more informative assessment in the detection of residual awareness. The aim of this study was to measure the correspondence between clinically defined level of awareness and neural responses within a single DOC patient. Methods: We used a follow-up fMRI design in combination with a passive speech-processing task. Patient's consciousness was measured through time by using the Coma Recovery Scale. Results: The patient progressed from a vegetative state (VS) to a minimally conscious state (MCS). Patient's task-related neural responses mirrored the clinical change from a VS to an MCS. Specifically, while in an MCS, but not a VS, the patient showed a selective recruitment of the left angular gyrus when he listened to a native speech narrative, as compared to the reverse presentation of the same stimulus. Furthermore, the patient showed an increased response in the language-related brain network and a greater deactivation in the default mode network following his progression to an MCS. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that longitudinal assessment of brain responses to passive stimuli can contribute to the definition of the clinical status in individual patients with DOC and represents an adequate counterpart of the bedside assessment during the diagnostic decision-making process.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.01.020,39,"Learning leads to rapid microstructural changes in gray (GM) and white (WM) matter. Do these changes continue to accumulate if task training continues, and can they be reverted by sleep? We addressed these questions by combining structural and diffusion weighted MRI and high-density EEG in 16 subjects studied during the physiological sleep/wake cycle, after 12 h and 24 h of intense practice in two different tasks, and after post-training sleep. Compared to baseline wake, 12 h of training led to a decline in cortical mean diffusivity. The decrease became even more significant after 24 h of task practice combined with sleep deprivation. Prolonged practice also resulted in decreased ventricular volume and increased GM and WM subcortical volumes. All changes reverted after recovery sleep. Moreover, these structural alterations predicted cognitive performance at the individual level, suggesting that sleep's ability to counteract performance deficits is linked to its effects on the brain microstructure. The cellular mechanisms that account for the structural effects of sleep are unknown, but they may be linked to its role in promoting the production of cerebrospinal fluid and the decrease in synapse size and strength, as well as to its recently discovered ability to enhance the extracellular space and the clearance of brain metabolites.","Bernardi, Giulio;Cecchetti, Luca;Siclari, Francesca;Buchmann, Andreas;Yu, Xiaoqian;Handjaras, Giacomo;Bellesi, Michele;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Kecskemeti, Steven R.;Riedner, Brady A.;Alexander, Andrew L.;Benca, Ruth M.;Ghilardi, M.

10.1007/s00429-014-0984-5,40,"While there is ample evidence that the structure and function of visual cortical areas are affected by early visual deprivation, little is known of how early blindness modifies subcortical relay and association thalamic nuclei, as well as mesencephalic structures. Therefore, in the present multicenter study, we used MRI to measure volume of the superior and inferior colliculi, as well as of the thalamic nuclei relaying sensory and motor information to the neocortex, parcellated according to atlas-based thalamo-cortical connections, in 29 individuals with congenital blindness of peripheral origin (17 M, age 35.7 ± 14.3 years) and 29 sighted subjects (17 M, age 31.9 ± 9.0). Blind participants showed an overall volume reduction in the left (p = 0.008) and right (p = 0.007) thalami, as compared to the sighted individuals. Specifically, the lateral geniculate (i.e., primary visual thalamic relay nucleus) was 40 % reduced (left: p = 4 × 10−6, right: p < 1 × 10−6), consistent with findings from animal studies. In addition, associated thalamic nuclei that project to temporal (left: p = 0.005, right: p = 0.005), prefrontal (left: p = 0.010, right: p = 0.014), occipital (left: p = 0.005, right: p = 0.023), and right premotor (p = 0.024) cortical regions were also significantly reduced in the congenitally blind group. Conversely, volumes of the relay nuclei directly involved in auditory, motor, and somatosensory processing were not affected by visual deprivation. In contrast, no difference in volume was observed in either the superior or the inferior colliculus between the two groups. Our findings indicate that visual loss since birth leads to selective volumetric changes within diencephalic, but not mesencephalic, structures. Both changes in reciprocal cortico-thalamic connections or modifications in the intrinsic connectivity between relay and association nuclei of the thalamus may contribute to explain these alterations in thalamic volumes. Sparing of the superior colliculi is in line with their composite, multisensory projections, and with their not exclusive visual nature.","Cecchetti, Luca;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Handjaras, Giacomo;Kupers, Ron;Ptito, Maurice;Pietrini, Pietro",56625136900;8565770200;35748302500;7003484370;7005537267;7005057128
10.3389/fnhum.2014.00888,34,"Driving is a complex behavior that requires the integration of multiple cognitive functions. While many studies have investigated brain activity related to driving simulation under distinct conditions, little is known about the brain morphological and functional architecture in professional competitive driving, which requires exceptional motor and navigational skills. Here, 11 professional racing-car drivers and 11 “naïve” volunteers underwent both structural and functional brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Subjects were presented with short movies depicting a Formula One car racing in four different official circuits. Brain activity was assessed in terms of regional response, using an Inter-Subject Correlation (ISC) approach, and regional interactions by mean of functional connectivity. In addition, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to identify specific structural differences between the two groups and potential interactions with functional differences detected by the ISC analysis. Relative to non-experienced drivers, professional drivers showed a more consistent recruitment of motor control and spatial navigation devoted areas, including premotor/motor cortex, striatum, anterior, and posterior cingulate cortex and retrosplenial cortex, precuneus, middle temporal cortex, and parahippocampus. Moreover, some of these brain regions, including the retrosplenial cortex, also had an increased gray matter density in professional car drivers. Furthermore, the retrosplenial cortex, which has been previously associated with the storage of observer-independent spatial maps, revealed a specific correlation with the individual driver's success in official competitions. These findings indicate that the brain functional and structural organization in highly trained racing-car drivers differs from that of subjects with an ordinary driving experience, suggesting that specific anatomo-functional changes may subtend the attainment of exceptional driving performance.","Bernardi, Giulio;Cecchetti, Luca;Handjaras, Giacomo;Sani, Lorenzo;Gaglianese, Anna;Ceccarelli, Riccardo;Franzoni, Ferdinando;Galetta, Fabio;Santoro, Gino;Goebel, Rainer;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Pietrini, Pietro",54988409300;56625136900;35748302500;21735510400;54986210200;55887744900;6701315185;7006410177;7201778481;7102516398;8565770200;7005057128
10.1016/j.brainresbull.2012.01.008,32,"In previous studies, we investigated a group of subjects who had suffered from a severe non missile traumatic brain injury (nmTBI) without macroscopic focal lesions and we found brain atrophy involving the hippocampus, fornix, corpus callosum, optic chiasm, and optic radiations. Memory test scores correlated mainly with fornix volumes [37,38].In the present study, we re-examined 11 of these nmTBI subjects approximately 8yr later. High-spatial resolution T1 weighted magnetic resonance images of the brain (1mm3) and standardised memory tests were performed once more in order to compare brain morphology and memory performance originally assessed 3-13 months after head injury (first study) and after 8-10yr (present study). An overall improvement of memory test performance was demonstrated in the latest assessment, indicating that cognitive recovery in severe nmTBI subjects had not been completed within 3-13 months post-injury. It is notable that the volumes of the fornix and the hippocampus were reduced significantly from normal controls, but these volumes do not differ appreciatively between nmTBI subjects at first (after ∼1yr) and at second (after ∼8yr) scans. On the contrary, a clear reduction in the volume of the corpus callosus can be observed after ∼1yr and a further significant reduction is evident after ∼8yr, indicating that the neural degeneration in severe nmTBI continues long after the head trauma and relates to specific structures and not to the overall brain. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Tomaiuolo, Francesco;Bivona, Umberto;Lerch, Jason P.;Di Paola, Margherita;Carlesimo, Giovanni A.;Ciurli, Paola;Matteis, Mariella;Cecchetti, Luca;Forcina, Antonio;Silvestro, Daniela;Azicnuda, Eva;Sabatini, Umberto;Di Giacomo, Dina;Caltagirone, Carlo;Petrides, Michael;Formisano, Rita",6701349113;6506439647;6602191436;7101759092;7005505376;6507286288;6701790078;56625136900;54989894200;24777051800;24775170900;7003704731;57738411700;35228717800;7006342140;7003725526
10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3411-11.2012,180,"Wemeasured temporal reproduction in human subjects with various levels of musical expertise: expert drummers, string musicians, and non-musicians. While duration reproduction of the non-percussionists showed a characteristic central tendency or regression to the mean, drummers responded veridically. Furthermore, when the stimuli were auditory tones rather than flashes, all subjects responded veridically. The behavior of all three groups in both modalities is well explained by a Bayesian model that seeks to minimize reproduction errors by incorporating a central tendency prior, a probability density function centered at the mean duration of the sample. We measured separately temporal precision thresholds with a bisection task; thresholds were twice as low in drummers as in the other two groups. These estimates of temporal precision, together with an adaptable Bayesian prior, predict well the reproduction results and the central tendency strategy under all conditions and for all subject groups. These results highlight the efficiency and flexibility of sensorimotor mechanisms estimating temporal duration.","Cicchini, Guido Marco;Arrighi, Roberto;Cecchetti, Luca;Giusti, Marco;Burr, David C.",24174252300;8870558800;56625136900;56651154200;7102039806

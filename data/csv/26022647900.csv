10.1016/j.socnet.2023.01.004,0,"In this paper we study whether “network closure” in the supply chain can explain the heterogeneity observed in firms’ performance. Using unique panel data on trade flows among beef farms in the Italian region of Piedmont, we analyze a sequential supply chain characterized by the co-existence of two production goods: domestic cattle, of lower quality but less risky, and imported cattle, of higher quality but exposed to higher risks. Our findings indicate that network closure, a characteristic commonly linked to the enhancement of trustworthy relations and mutual cooperation, is associated with an increase in the performance of farms adopting the riskier production system. On the other hand, network closure does not affect the performance of farms using the more traditional and mature technology. Thus, trust may promote the use of inputs of superior quality.","Muscillo, Alessio;Pin, Paolo;Razzolini, Tiziano;Serti, Francesco",57218949192;36818424000;26024453100;26022647900
10.1080/00343404.2023.2206868,1,"The literature unanimously agrees that industrial diversification is path dependent: new industries build on the pre-existing capabilities of regions that are partly embodied and reflected in the skills of the region’s workforce. This paper explicitly accounts for regional capabilities as workforce skills to build skill relatedness and skill complexity measures, that is, the skill-spaces, for 107 Italian regions for the period 2013–19. The data-driven techniques we use reveal that skill-spaces form two highly polarised clusters into social–cognitive and technical–physical skills. We find evidence that social–cognitive skills yield the highest probabilities of regional competitive advantage. A comparison with co-location-based measures shows that our measures are able to capture a substantial part of regional capabilities that cannot be measured with previous measures.","Buyukyazici, Duygu;Mazzoni, Leonardo;Riccaboni, Massimo;Serti, Francesco",57747058600;57211975877;6603650921;26022647900
10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115438,4,"The impact of COVID-19 represents a specific challenge for voluntary transfusional systems sustained by the intrinsic motivations of blood donors. In general, health emergencies can stimulate altruistic behaviors. However, in this context, the same prosocial motivations, besides the personal health risks, could foster the adherence to social distancing rules to preserve collective health and, therefore, discourage blood donation activities. In this work, we investigate the consequences of the pandemic shock on the dynamics of new donors exploiting the individual-level longitudinal information contained in administrative data on the Italian region of Tuscany. We compare the change in new donors' recruitment and retention during 2020 with respect to the 2017–2019 period (we observe 9511 individuals), considering donors’ and their municipalities of residence characteristics. Our results show an increment of new donors, with higher proportional growth for older donors. Moreover, we demonstrate that the quality of new donors, as proxied by the frequency of subsequent donations, increased with respect to previous years. Finally, we show that changes in extrinsic motivations, such as the possibility of obtaining a free antibody test or overcoming movement restrictions, cannot explain the documented increase in the number of new donors and in their performance. Therefore, our analyses indicate that the Tuscan voluntary blood donation system was effective in dealing with the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bilancini, Ennio;Boncinelli, Leonardo;Di Paolo, Roberto;Menicagli, Dario;Pizziol, Veronica;Ricciardi, Emiliano;Serti, Francesco",24175889200;24175528900;57201116811;57199647974;57226799439;8565770200;26022647900

10.1111/caje.12467,5,"Abstract.: This paper offers both a theoretical framework and empirical evidence on the role that the two gravity forces, namely market size and geographical distance, have indirectly through imports, on firms’ exports patterns. The model shows that sourcing from bigger and closer markets implies higher productivity gains that, in turn, increase firms’ ability to enter export market as well as their export value. Exploiting data on product- and destination-level transactions of a large panel of Italian firms, the paper shows that, on average, the indirect effects of the gravity forces are about one third of their direct effects. Résumé.: Rôle des forces de gravité sur le commerce des entreprises. Cet article offre à la fois un cadre théorique et des preuves empiriques sur le rôle que deux forces de gravité, à savoir la taille du marché et l’éloignement géographique, peuvent indirectement exercer sur les profils d’exportation des entreprise en fonction de leurs importations. Ce modèle montre que l’approvisionnement sur des marchés plus vastes et plus proches engendre de meilleurs gains de productivité, augmentant ainsi la capacité des entreprises à intégrer le marché d’exportation ainsi que la valeur de leurs exportations. En s’appuyant sur des données provenant d’un large panel d’entreprises italiennes et relatives aux transactions par type de produit et par destination, cet article montre qu’en moyenne, les effets indirects des forces de gravité représentent environ un tiers de leurs effets directs.","Navas, Antonio;Serti, Francesco;Tomasi, Chiara",39362206400;26022647900;26022669000
10.1111/sjoe.12285,3,"Using a unique dataset from Italy, we show that the local unemployment rate at entry has a persistent positive effect on severe and non-severe workplace injuries of young workers. Entrants during recessions, despite receiving marginally higher entry wages, also experience slower wage growth. The observed pattern in the differences between severe and non-severe injuries indicates that entrants during recessions might under-report non-severe workplace injuries. Our findings suggest that workers entering during recessions are persistently locked into low-quality jobs and that the mix of hazardous tasks endogenously adjusts to the business cycle.","Leombruni, Roberto;Razzolini, Tiziano;Serti, Francesco",6506222688;26024453100;26022647900
10.1007/s00181-013-0783-5,3,"Using a rich firm-level dataset on the Italian manufacturing industry, this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the role that firms and market characteristics play in shaping firms’ trade activities. We enhance the previous analyses by considering firms’ engagement in international transactions, by focusing on either exports or imports. We show that the determinants of a firm’s export participation and value across countries also drive import behavior. Our research is consistent with the presence of country-specific sunk costs and with a qualitatively similar role of gravity forces and other country attributes on both sides of trading activities. Our evidence, however, militates in favor of a framework where variations in market characteristics have a larger impact on imports than exports.","Serti, Francesco;Tomasi, Chiara",26022647900;26022669000

We contribute to empirical research on these issues in three ways. First, we provide new evidence that is consistent with multi-attribute models on firm heterogeneity and trade. We show that even after controlling for various company characteristics, including size and capital intensity, exporters still pay higher wages and employ more skilled workers than nonexporters. Second, we consider engagement in international transactions, either by means of exports, imports, or a combination of the two. We show that failing to control for importing activities may bias upward export premia. Third, we look at how the wage and the employment structures of trading firms change with the country of destination and origin of trade flows. We find that wage and skill premia are influenced by the characteristics of partner countries. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Serti, Francesco;Tomasi, Chiara;Zanfei, Antonello",26022647900;26022669000;57221660677
10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01262.x,142,"Combining data on structural characteristics and economic performance for a large sample of Italian firms with data on exporting and importing activity, we uncover evidence supporting recent theories on firm heterogeneity and international trade, together with some new facts. In particular, we find that importing is associated with substantial firm heterogeneity. First, we document that trade is more concentrated than employment and sales, and show that importing is even more concentrated than exporting both within sectors and along the sector- and country-extensive margins. Second, while supporting the fact that firms involved in both are the best performers, we also find that firms involved only in importing activities perform better than those involved only in exporting. Our evidence suggests there is a strong self-selection effect in the case of importers and the performance premia of internationalised firms correlate relatively more with the degree of geographical and sectoral diversification of imports. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Castellani, Davide;Serti, Francesco;Tomasi, Chiara",23099404100;26022647900;26022669000

Using a rich database on Italian manufacturing firms, we test the self-selection and the post-entry effects hypotheses with respect to various firms' characteristics. Our analysis supports the idea that the superior performance of the exporters is due not only to a market selection mechanism, but also to efficiency improvements following the export activity. We find heterogeneous post-entry effects with respect to characteristics as geographical location, size and sector. To test the post-entry hypothesis we implement the propensity score matching and differences-in-differences techniques. © 2008 Kiel Institute.","Serti, Francesco;Tomasi, Chiara",26022647900;26022669000
10.1007/s10290-008-0163-y,146,"We use comparable micro level panel data for 14 countries and a set of identically specified empirical models to investigate the relationship between exports and productivity. Our overall results are in line with the big picture that is by now familiar from the literature: exporters are more productive than non-exporters when observed and unobserved heterogeneity is controlled for, and these exporter productivity premia tend to increase with the share of exports in total sales; there is evidence in favour of self-selection of more productive firms into export markets, but nearly no evidence in favour of the learning-by-exporting hypothesis. We document that the exporter premia differ considerably across countries in identically specified empirical models. In a meta-analysis of our results we find, consistent with theoretical predictions, that productivity premia are larger in countries with lower export participation rates, with more restrictive trade policies, lower per capita GDP, less effective government and worse regulatory quality, and in countries exporting to relatively more distant markets. © 2008 Kiel Institute.","Wagner, Joachim;Pertl, Leonhard;Schiavo, Stefano;Muuls, Mirabelle;Pisu, Mauro;Alvarez, Roberto;Jaramillo, Patricio;Lopez, Ricardo A.;van Biesebroeck, Johannes;Brandt, Loren;Zhang, Yifan;Fernandes, Ana M.;Isgut, Alberto;Jørgensen, Rasmus;Kaiser, Ulrich;Bellone, Flora;Jabbour, Liza;Musso, Patrick;Nesta, Lionel;Fryges, Helmut;Castellani, Davide;Serti, Francesco;Tomasi, Chiara;Zanfei, Antonelli;Ruane, Frances;Damijan, Joze P.;Kostevc, Crt;Polanec, Saso;Fariñas, Jose C.;Máñez, Juan A.;Martin, Ana;Rochina, Maria E.;Sanchis, Juan A.;Andersson, Martin;Johansson, Sara;Greenaway, David;Kneller, Richard",35099687100;36802578300;23100915500;26534567600;7003838764;7202902704;34973008700;10145052600;9434304900;7202731518;35095801200;18834906800;6602529509;57197080792;57212952706;24528491800;26026547200;23668459900;16176300900;15030031600;23099404100;26022647900;26022669000;57221660677;6603312764;6506357710;14828857400;6507397167;7004205742;6506818013;16068973800;16744003000;12775957700;57216132623;36337823300;7003338114;6701832115

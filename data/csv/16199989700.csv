10.1098/rsif.2020.0093,6,"We present a simple three-dimensional model to describe the autonomous expansion of a substrate whose growth is driven by the local mean curvature of its surface. The model aims to reproduce the nest construction process in arboreal Nasutitermes termites, whose cooperation may similarly be mediated by the shape of the structure they are walking on, for example focusing the building activity of termites where local mean curvature is high. We adopt a phase-field model where the nest is described by one continuous scalar field and its growth is governed by a single nonlinear equation with one adjustable parameter d. When d is large enough the equation is linearly unstable and fairly reproduces a growth process in which the initial walls expand, branch and merge, while progressively invading all the available space, which is consistent with the intricate structures of real nests. Interestingly, the linear problem associated with our growth equation is analogous to the buckling of a thin elastic plate under symmetric in-plane compression, which is also known to produce rich patterns through nonlinear and secondary instabilities. We validated our model by collecting nests of two species of arboreal Nasutitermes from the field and imaging their structure with a micro-computed tomography scanner. We found a strong resemblance between real and simulated nests, characterized by the emergence of a characteristic length scale and by the abundance of saddle-shaped surfaces with zero-mean curvature, which validates the choice of the driving mechanism of our growth model.","Facchini, G.;Lazarescu, A.;Perna, A.;Douady, S.",57196594915;43661346300;16199989700;6701806111
10.1007/s00114-020-01675-0,5,"Nests of social insects are an important area for the exchange of food and information among workers. We investigated how the topology of nest chambers (as opposed to nest size or environmental factors) affects the spatial distribution of nestmates and the foraging behavior of Myrmica rubra ant colonies. Colonies were housed in artificial nests, each with same-sized chambers differing in the spatial arrangement of galleries. A highly connected central chamber favored higher occupancy rates and a more homogeneous distribution of ants across chambers. In contrast, a chain of successive chambers led to a more heterogeneous distribution of ants, with the occupancy of a chamber chiefly mediated by its distance to the entrance. Irrespective of nest topology, the entrance chamber housed the largest proportion of ants, often including the queen, which exhibited a preference for staying in densely populated chambers. Finally, we investigated how nest topology influenced nestmate recruitment. Surprisingly, a highly connected chamber in the center of the nest did not promote greater recruitment nor activation of ants. At the onset of foraging, the largest number of moving ants was reached in the topology where the most connected chamber was the nest entrance. Later in the process, we found that a chain of successive chambers was the best topology for promoting ant’s mobilization. Our work demonstrates that nest topology can shape the spatial organization and the collective response of ant colonies, thereby taking part in their adaptative strategies to exploit environmental resources.","Vaes, Oscar;Perna, Andrea;Detrain, Claire",57216889608;16199989700;6701582926
10.1111/ibi.12710,15,"We understand little about the energetic costs of flight in free-ranging birds, in part because current techniques for estimating flight energetics in the wild are limited. Accelerometry is known to estimate energy expenditure through body movement in terrestrial animals, once calibrated using a treadmill with chamber respirometry. The flight equivalent, a wind tunnel with mask respirometry, is particularly difficult to instigate, and has not been applied to calibrate accelerometry. We take the first steps in exploring a novel method for calibrating accelerometers with flight energy expenditure. We collected accelerometry data for Harris's Hawks Parabuteo unicinctus flying to varying heights up to 4.1 m over a small horizontal distance; the mechanical energy expended to gain height can be estimated from physical first principles. The relationship between accelerometry and mechanical energy expenditure was strong, and while a simple wing flapping model confirmed that accelerometry is sensitive to both changes in wing beat amplitude and frequency, the relationship was explained predominately by changes in wing beat frequency, and less so by changes in amplitude. Our study provides initial, positive evidence that accelerometry can be calibrated with body power using climbing flights, potentially providing a basis for estimating flapping flight metabolic rate at least in situations of altitude gain.","Van Walsum, Tessa A.;Perna, Andrea;Bishop, Charles M.;Murn, Campbell P.;Collins, Philip M.;Wilson, Rory P.;Halsey, Lewis G.",57195523910;16199989700;7202946737;6506197824;56088003500;7501526090;6701887278

Whether common mechanisms underpin the size structure of unicellular and multicellular autotrophs is, however, unknown. Using a global data compilation, we show that individual body masses in tree and phytoplankton communities follow power-law distributions and that the average exponents of these individual size distributions (ISD) differ. Phytoplankton communities are characterized by an average ISD exponent consistent with three-quarter-power scaling of metabolism with body mass and equivalence in energy use among mass classes. Tree communities deviate from this pattern in a manner consistent with equivalence in energy use among diameter size classes. Our findings suggest that whilst universal metabolic constraints ultimately underlie the emergent size structure of autotroph communities, divergent aspects of body size (volumetric vs. linear dimensions) shape the ecological outcome of metabolic scaling in forest vs. pelagic ecosystems.","Perkins, Daniel M.;Perna, Andrea;Adrian, Rita;Cermeño, Pedro;Gaedke, Ursula;Huete-Ortega, Maria;White, Ethan P.;Yvon-Durocher, Gabriel",35318508500;16199989700;7103321653;8842965300;6701317546;23481640600;7401613097;15844582700
10.1098/rsif.2019.0212,3,"Group living animals form aggregations and flocks that remain cohesive in spite of internal movements of individuals. This is possible because individual group members repeatedly adjust their position and motion in response to the position and motion of other group members. Here, we develop a theoretical approach to address the question, what general features—if any—underlie the interaction rules that mediate group stability in animals of all species? We do so by considering how the spatial organization of a group would change in the complete absence of interactions. Without interactions, a group would disperse in a way that can be easily characterized in terms of Fick’s diffusion equations. We can hence address the inverse theoretical problem of finding the individual-level interaction responses that are required to counterbalance diffusion and to preserve group stability. We show that an individual-level response to neighbour densities in the form of Weber’s Law (a ‘universal’ law describing the functioning of the sensory systems of animals of all species) results in an ‘anti-diffusion’ term at the group level. On short timescales, this anti-diffusion restores the initial group configuration in a way that is reminiscent of methods for image deblurring in image processing. We also show that any non-homogeneous, spatial density distribution can be preserved over time if individual movement patterns have the form of a Weber’s Law response. Weber’s Law describes the fundamental functioning of perceptual systems. Our study indicates that it is also a necessary—but not sufficient—feature of collective interactions in stable animal groups.","Perna, Andrea;Facchini, Giulio;Deneubourg, Jean Louis",16199989700;57196594915;7004387896
10.1242/jeb.197434,7,"Analysis of some experimental biology data involves linear regression and interpretation of the resulting slope value. Usually, the x-axis measurements include noise. Noise in the x-variable can create regression dilution, and many biologists are not aware of the implications: regression dilution results in an underestimation of the true slope value. This is particularly problematic when the slope value is diagnostic. For example, energy management strategies of animals can be determined from the regression slope estimate of mean energy expenditure against resting energy expenditure. Typically, energy expenditure is represented by a proxy such as heart rate, which adds substantive measurement error. With simulations and analysis of empirical data, we explore the possible effect of regression dilution on interpretations of energy management strategies. We conclude that unless the coefficient of determination r2 is very high, there is a good possibility that regression dilution will affect qualitative interpretation. We recommend some ways to contend with regression dilution, including the application of alternative available regression approaches under certain circumstances.","Halsey, Lewis G.;Perna, Andrea",6701887278;16199989700

How the brain processes information about neighbours’ positions and movements may affect how individuals interact in groups. As brain size can determine such information processing it should impact collective animal movement. Here we investigate whether brain size affects the structure and organisation of newly forming fish shoals by quantifying the collective movement of guppies (Poecilia reticulata) from large- and small-brained selection lines, with known differences in learning and memory. We used automated tracking software to determine shoaling behaviour of single-sex groups of eight or two fish and found no evidence that brain size affected the speed, group size, or spatial and directional organisation of fish shoals. Our results suggest that brain size does not play an important role in how fish interact with each other in these types of moving groups of unfamiliar individuals. Based on these results, we propose that shoal dynamics are likely to be governed by relatively basic cognitive processes that do not differ in these brain size selected lines of guppies.","Kotrschal, Alexander;Szorkovszky, Alexander;Romenskyy, Maksym;Perna, Andrea;Buechel, Severine D.;Zeng, Hong Li;Pelckmans, Kristiaan;Sumpter, David;Kolm, Niclas",24401153000;24469202700;55651198600;16199989700;36482417600;57194173787;9275487200;6602893688;6602955806
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005822,46,"Schools of fish and flocks of birds can move together in synchrony and decide on new directions of movement in a seamless way. This is possible because group members constantly share directional information with their neighbors. Although detecting the directionality of other group members is known to be important to maintain cohesion, it is not clear how many neighbors each individual can simultaneously track and pay attention to, and what the spatial distribution of these influential neighbors is. Here, we address these questions on shoals of Hemigrammus rhodostomus, a species of fish exhibiting strong schooling behavior. We adopt a data-driven analysis technique based on the study of short-term directional correlations to identify which neighbors have the strongest influence over the participation of an individual in a collective U-turn event. We find that fish mainly react to one or two neighbors at a time. Moreover, we find no correlation between the distance rank of a neighbor and its likelihood to be influential. We interpret our results in terms of fish allocating sequential and selective attention to their neighbors.","Jiang, Li;Giuggioli, Luca;Perna, Andrea;Escobedo, Ramón;Lecheval, Valentin;Sire, Clément;Han, Zhangang;Theraulaz, Guy",56367949800;8090235100;16199989700;6603516544;56305998100;7003883309;55032189600;7004591018
10.1098/rspb.2017.1126,91,"Predation is thought to shape the macroscopic properties of animal groups, making moving groups more cohesive and coordinated. Precisely how predation has shaped individuals’ fine-scale social interactions in natural populations, however, is unknown. Using high-resolution tracking data of shoaling fish (Poecilia reticulata) from populations differing in natural predation pressure, we show how predation adapts individuals’ social interaction rules. Fish originating from high predation environments formed larger, more cohesive, but not more polarized groups than fish from low predation environments. Using a new approach to detect the discrete points in time when individuals decide to update their movements based on the available social cues, we determine how these collective properties emerge from individuals’ microscopic social interactions. We first confirm predictions that predation shapes the attraction–repulsion dynamic of these fish, reducing the critical distance at which neighbours move apart, or come back together. While we find strong evidence that fish align with their near neighbours, we do not find that predation shapes the strength or likelihood of these alignment tendencies. We also find that predation sharpens individuals’ acceleration and deceleration responses, implying key perceptual and energetic differences associated with how individuals move in different predation regimes. Our results reveal how predation can shape the social interactions of individuals in groups, ultimately driving differences in groups’ collective behaviour.","Herbert-Read, James E.;Rosén, Emil;Szorkovszky, Alex;Ioannou, Christos C.;Rogell, Björn;Perna, Andrea;Ramnarine, Indar W.;Kotrschal, Alexander;Kolm, Niclas;Krause, Jens;Sumpter, David J.T.",35726673000;57195522817;24469202700;14031534600;9640421100;16199989700;6603763150;24401153000;6602955806;7202955124;6602893688

In this study, we used a population of plasmodia that interconnect through time to analyse the dynamical interactions between growth of individual plasmodia and global network formation.

By scanning these nests with X-ray tomography we observed that two different configurations of vertical passages coexist: Ramps and helices. Based on our current knowledge of the mechanisms of nest building behaviour in different groups of social insects we formulate hypotheses about the mechanisms that could lead to the formation of these structures. In particular, we show that a 3D model of nest building in Lasius Niger ants (Khuong et al, 2016) is capable of producing layered structures with vertical helices similar to the structures built by Apicotermes by simply running it with parameters different from those empirically measured for ants. It is possible that similar self-organised building mechanisms underlie the construction of the different nest structures produced by different groups of social insects.","Guo, Lijie;Theraulaz, Guy;Jost, Christian;Perna, Andrea",57193134440;7004591018;7005169161;16199989700
10.1073/pnas.1509829113,71,"The nests of social insects are not only impressive because of their sheer complexity but also because they are built from individuals whose work is not centrally coordinated. A key question is how groups of insects coordinate their building actions. Here, we use a combination of experimental and modeling approaches to investigate nest construction in the ant Lasius Niger. We quantify the construction dynamics and the 3D structures built by ants. Then, we characterize individual behaviors and the interactions of ants with the structures they build. We show that two main interactions are involved in the coordination of building actions: (i) a stigmergic-based interaction that controls the amplification of depositions at some locations and is attributable to a pheromone added by ants to the building material; and (ii) a template-based interaction in which ants use their body size as a cue to control the height at which they start to build a roof from existing pillars. We then develop a 3D stochastic model based on these individual behaviors to analyze the effect of pheromone presence and strength on construction dynamics. We show that the model can quantitatively reproduce key features of construction dynamics, including a large-scale pattern of regularly spaced pillars, the formation and merging of caps over the pillars, and the remodeling of built structures. Finally, our model suggests that the lifetime of the pheromone is a highly influential parameter that controls the growth and form of nest architecture.","Khuong, Anaïs;Gautrais, Jacques;Perna, Andrea;Sbaï, Chaker;Combe, Maud;Kuntz, Pascale;Jost, Christian;Theraulaz, Guy",55670070600;6506823391;16199989700;57090998200;23388516900;7004843798;7005169161;7004591018
10.1103/PhysRevE.92.062810,4,"We present a model for the growth of the transportation network inside nests of the social insect subfamily Termitinae (Isoptera, termitidae). These nests consist of large chambers (nodes) connected by tunnels (edges). The model based on the empirical analysis of the real nest networks combined with pruning (edge removal, either random or weighted by betweenness centrality) and a memory effect (preferential growth from the latest added chambers) successfully predicts emergent nest properties (degree distribution, size of the largest connected component, average path lengths, backbone link ratios, and local graph redundancy). The two pruning alternatives can be associated with different genuses in the subfamily. A sensitivity analysis on the pruning and memory parameters indicates that Termitinae networks favor fast internal transportation over efficient defense strategies against ant predators. Our results provide an example of how complex network organization and efficient network properties can be generated from simple building rules based on local interactions and contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that come into play for the formation of termite networks and of biological transportation networks in general.","Eom, Young Ho;Perna, Andrea;Fortunato, Santo;Darrouzet, Eric;Theraulaz, Guy;Jost, Christian",8454032000;16199989700;7005680829;6603942606;7004591018;7005169161

In this review, we discuss three key areas in the study of animal transportation networks: the topological properties of networks, network morphogenesis and growth, and the behaviour of network users. We present a brief primer on elements of network theory, and then discuss the different ways in which animal groups deal with the fundamental trade-off between the competing network properties of travel efficiency, robustness and infrastructure cost.We consider howthe behaviour of network users can impact network efficiency, and call for studies that integrate both network topology and user behaviour.

Here, we propose a complementary approach to the analysis of flocking phenomena, based on the idea that animals occupy preferential, anysotropic positions with respect to their neighbours, and devote a large amount of their interaction responses to maintaining their mutual positions. We test our approach by deriving the apparent alignment and attraction responses from simulated trajectories of animals moving side by side, or one in front of the other. We show that the anisotropic positioning of individuals, in combination with noise, is sufficient to reproduce several aspects of the movement responses observed in real animal groups. This anisotropy at the level of interactions should be considered explicitly in future models of flocking and schooling. By making a distinction between interaction responses involved in maintaining a preferred flock configuration, and interaction responses directed at changing it, our work provides a frame to discriminate movement interactions that signal directional conflict from interactions underlying consensual group motion.","Perna, Andrea;Grégoire, Guillaume;Mann, Richard P.",16199989700;7005342113;35248716800
10.1098/rsif.2013.0529,72,"Travelling in groups gives animals opportunities to share route information by following cues from each other's movement. The outcome of group navigation will depend on how individuals respond to each other within a flock, school, swarm or herd. Despite the abundance of modelling studies, only recently have researchers developed techniques to determine the interaction rules among real animals. Here, we use high-resolution GPS (global positioning system) tracking to study these interactions in pairs of pigeons flying home from a familiar site. Momentary changes in velocity indicate alignment with the neighbour's direction, as well as attraction or avoidance depending on distance. Responses were stronger when the neighbour was in front. From the flocking behaviour, we develop a model to predict features of group navigation. Specifically, we show that the interactions between pigeons stabilize a side-by-side configuration, promoting bidirectional information transfer and reducing the risk of separation. However, if one bird gets in front it will lead directional choices. Our model further predicts, and observations confirm, that a faster bird (as measured from solo flights) will fly slightly in front and thus dominate the choice of homing route.

The increase in speed, in particular, seems to be a consequence of the movement-mediated nature of the interactions used by fish to share information. The present work aims at investigating the link between movement and information transfer underlying collective decisions in fish. We define an individual-based self-propelled particle (SPP) model of the decision-making process analyzed by Ward et al. We fit it to data in order to deduce the smallest set of interaction rules consistent with the experimentally observed behaviour. We infer the relative weight of different social forces on fish movement during the decision-making process. We find that, in order to reproduce the observed experimental trends, both the social forces of alignment and attraction have to be introduced in the model, alignment playing a more important role than attraction.

10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002961,34,"Inference of interaction rules of animals moving in groups usually relies on an analysis of large scale system behaviour. Models are tuned through repeated simulation until they match the observed behaviour. More recent work has used the fine scale motions of animals to validate and fit the rules of interaction of animals in groups. Here, we use a Bayesian methodology to compare a variety of models to the collective motion of glass prawns (Paratya australiensis). We show that these exhibit a stereotypical 'phase transition', whereby an increase in density leads to the onset of collective motion in one direction. We fit models to this data, which range from: a mean-field model where all prawns interact globally; to a spatial Markovian model where prawns are self-propelled particles influenced only by the current positions and directions of their neighbours; up to non-Markovian models where prawns have 'memory' of previous interactions, integrating their experiences over time when deciding to change behaviour. We show that the mean-field model fits the large scale behaviour of the system, but does not capture the observed locality of interactions. Traditional self-propelled particle models fail to capture the fine scale dynamics of the system. The most sophisticated model, the non-Markovian model, provides a good match to the data at both the fine scale and in terms of reproducing global dynamics, while maintaining a biologically plausible perceptual range. We conclude that prawns' movements are influenced by not just the current direction of nearby conspecifics, but also those encountered in the recent past. Given the simplicity of prawns as a study system our research suggests that self-propelled particle models of collective motion should, if they are to be realistic at multiple biological scales, include memory of previous interactions and other non-Markovian effects. © 2013 Mann et al.","Mann, Richard P.;Perna, Andrea;Strömbom, Daniel;Garnett, Roman;Herbert-Read, James E.;Sumpter, David J.T.;Ward, Ashley J.W.",35248716800;16199989700;39863680000;34874855000;35726673000;6602893688;35579996400

It characterizes for any given movement dynamics (such as random walks) the average number of nodes that can be reached in exactly h steps (out-accessibility), or the average number of nodes from which a given node can be reached (in-accessibility). This focus on dynamics makes accessibility particularly appropriate to study movement on networks and to detect complementary properties with respect to topology-based measurements such as betweenness centrality. We apply this measure to six nests of Cubitermes termites. Their mushroom-like 3D architectures consist of chambers and connecting tunnels that can be associated to nodes and edges in a communication network. Accessibilities turn out to be particularly low in the bottom part of the nests that link them to their underground tunneling network.

10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002592,84,"We studied the formation of trail patterns by Argentine ants exploring an empty arena. Using a novel imaging and analysis technique we estimated pheromone concentrations at all spatial positions in the experimental arena and at different times. Then we derived the response function of individual ants to pheromone concentrations by looking at correlations between concentrations and changes in speed or direction of the ants. Ants were found to turn in response to local pheromone concentrations, while their speed was largely unaffected by these concentrations. Ants did not integrate pheromone concentrations over time, with the concentration of pheromone in a 1 cm radius in front of the ant determining the turning angle. The response to pheromone was found to follow a Weber's Law, such that the difference between quantities of pheromone on the two sides of the ant divided by their sum determines the magnitude of the turning angle. This proportional response is in apparent contradiction with the well-established non-linear choice function used in the literature to model the results of binary bridge experiments in ant colonies (Deneubourg et al. 1990). However, agent based simulations implementing the Weber's Law response function led to the formation of trails and reproduced results reported in the literature. We show analytically that a sigmoidal response, analogous to that in the classical Deneubourg model for collective decision making, can be derived from the individual Weber-type response to pheromone concentrations that we have established in our experiments when directional noise around the preferred direction of movement of the ants is assumed. © 2012 Perna et al.","Perna, Andrea;Granovskiy, Boris;Garnier, Simon;Nicolis, Stamatios C.;Labédan, Marjorie;Theraulaz, Guy;Fourcassié, Vincent;Sumpter, David J.T.",16199989700;55178546300;13006090300;7004595221;55327700300;7004591018;6603453140;6602893688
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002308,12,"Inference of interaction rules of animals moving in groups usually relies on an analysis of large scale system behaviour. Models are tuned through repeated simulation until they match the observed behaviour. More recent work has used the fine scale motions of animals to validate and fit the rules of interaction of animals in groups. Here, we use a Bayesian methodology to compare a variety of models to the collective motion of glass prawns (Paratya australiensis). We show that these exhibit a stereotypical 'phase transition', whereby an increase in density leads to the onset of collective motion in one direction. We fit models to this data, which range from: a mean-field model where all prawns interact globally; to a spatial Markovian model where prawns are self-propelled particles influenced only by the current positions and directions of their neighbours; up to non-Markovian models where prawns have 'memory' of previous interactions, integrating their experiences over time when deciding to change behaviour. We show that the mean-field model fits the large scale behaviour of the system, but does not capture fine scale rules of interaction, which are primarily mediated by physical contact. Conversely, the Markovian self-propelled particle model captures the fine scale rules of interaction but fails to reproduce global dynamics. The most sophisticated model, the non-Markovian model, provides a good match to the data at both the fine scale and in terms of reproducing global dynamics. We conclude that prawns' movements are influenced by not just the current direction of nearby conspecifics, but also those encountered in the recent past. Given the simplicity of prawns as a study system our research suggests that self-propelled particle models of collective motion should, if they are to be realistic at multiple biological scales, include memory of previous interactions and other non-Markovian effects. © 2012 Mann et al.","Mann, Richard P.;Perna, Andrea;Strömbom, Daniel;Garnett, Roman;Herbert-Read, James E.;Sumpter, David J.T.;Ward, Ashley J.W.",35248716800;16199989700;39863680000;34874855000;35726673000;6602893688;35579996400
10.4018/978-1-61350-092-7.ch007,5,"Social insect colonies build large net-like systems: gallery and trail networks. Many such networks appear to show near-optimal performance. Focusing on the network system inside termite nests we address the question how simple agents with probabilistic behaviour can control and optimize the growth of a structure with size several magnitude orders above their perceptual range. We identify two major classes of mechanisms: (i) purely local mechanisms, which involve the arrangement of simple motifs according to predetermined rules of behaviour and (ii) local estimation of global quantities, where sizes, lengths, and numbers are estimated from densities, concentrations, and traffic. Theoretical considerations suggest that purely local mechanisms work better during early network formation and are less likely to fall into local optima. On the contrary, estimation of global properties is only possible on functional networks and is more likely to work through pruning. This latter mechanism may contribute to restore network functionalities following unpredicted changes of external conditions or network topology. An analysis of the network properties of Cubitermes termite nests supports the role of both classes of mechanisms, possibly in interplay with environmental conditions acting as a template. © 2012, IGI Global.","Perna, Andrea;Kuntz, Pascale;Theraulaz, Guy;Jost, Christian",16199989700;7004843798;7004591018;7005169161
10.1073/pnas.1109355108,375,"Collective motion, where large numbers of individuals move synchronously together, is achieved when individuals adopt interaction rules that determine how they respond to their neighbors'movements and positions. These rules determine how group-living animals move, make decisions, and transmit information between individuals. Nonetheless, few studies have explicitly determined these interaction rules in moving groups, and very little is known about the interaction rules of fish. Here,we identify three key rules for the social interactions of mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki): (i) Attraction forces are important in maintaining group cohesion, while we find only weak evidence that fish align with their neighbor's orientation; (ii) repulsion is mediated principally by changes in speed; (iii) although the positions and directions of all shoal members are highly correlated, individuals only respond to their single nearest neighbor. The last two of these rules are different from the classical models of collective animal motion, raising new questions about how fish and other animals self-organize on the move.","Herbert-Read, James E.;Perna, Andrea;Mann, Richard P.;Schaerf, Timothy M.;Sumpter, David J.T.;Ward, Ashley J.W.",35726673000;16199989700;35248716800;36609205600;6602893688;35579996400
10.1103/PhysRevE.83.066106,24,"We propose a method for quantitative characterization of spatial networklike patterns with loops, such as surface fracture patterns, leaf vein networks, and patterns of urban streets. Such patterns are not well characterized by purely topological estimators: also patterns that both look different and result from different morphogenetic processes can have similar topology. A local geometric cue-the angles formed by the different branches at junctions-can complement topological information and allow the quantification of the large scale spatial coherence of the pattern. For patterns that grow over time, such as fracture lines on the surface of ceramics, the rank assigned by our method to each individual segment of the pattern approximates the order of appearance of that segment. We apply the method to various networklike patterns and find a continuous but sharp dichotomy between two classes of spatial networks: hierarchical and homogeneous. The former class results from a sequential growth process and presents large scale organization, and the latter presents local, but not global, organization. © 2011 American Physical Society.","Perna, Andrea;Kuntz, Pascale;Douady, Stéphane",16199989700;7004843798;6701806111
10.7551/978-0-262-29714-1-ch061,10,"The nests of social insects are not only impressive because of their sheer complexity, but also because they are built from much smaller agents whose work is not centrally coordinated. A central question is therefore how this coordination can lead to such large scale structures. In this paper we present an individual based nest construction model from experimentally inspired rules. The coordination of the building process is achieved through three main ingredients: 1) stigmergy, which implies that the local configuration of the structure is the stimulus which determines how to continue, 2) body template, where the interaction between the ant's body and the growing structure determines the proportions of the emerging pattern, and 3) a construction”pheromone”, a chemical compound capable of triggering building actions. Our simulations show that this simple set of coordination rules can reproduce the key features observed experimentally in the ant Lasius niger, notably the emergence of mushroom-like pillars and layered structures. A sensitivity analysis on the evaporation rate of the construction pheromone shows that a large range of architectures, from dynamic multilayered nests to compact sponge-like structures, can be produced with the same behavioural rules by simply modifying evaporation rate. We discuss the relevance of these results with respect to the variety of nest architectures found in social insects.","Khuong, Anaïs;Theraulaz, Guy;Jost, Christian;Perna, Andrea;Gautrais, Jacques",55670070600;7004591018;7005169161;16199989700;6506823391

10.1167/8.10.15,20,"Human psychophysical observations, computational models, and the selectivity of neurons in primary visual cortex all suggest that an early step in visual processing is the detection of features such as lines and edges. However, previous fMRI experiments investigating the responses of early visual areas to phase coherence have led to apparently discordant results. We studied the human brain BOLD responses to structured periodic band-pass images of matched amplitude spectrum but of different phase spectra, arranged to create three distinct types of stimuli: pure edges; pure lines (matched global and local energy to the edges, but different phase); and random noise (random phase spectrum, hence no salient features, and a different spatial distribution of local energy from the lines and edges stimuli). Alternation of lines against edges did not activate primary visual cortex, but did activate two higher order visual areas. Alternation of these lines or edges against the random stimulus produced a strong activity in many visual areas, including primary visual cortex. Interestingly, the BOLD activity was higher for the edges and lines than for the random stimuli for a wide range of stimulus contrasts, indicating the presence of non-linear gain modulation in the cell response. These results show that phase congruency is coded at the level of primary visual cortex. We show that a stage of response gain modulation can explain our present and previous fMRI discordant results. © ARVO.","Perna, Andrea;Tosetti, Michela;Montanaro, Domenico;Morrone, Maria Concetta",16199989700;6701756843;36764310900;7004710787

We here analyse some topological properties of three dimensional networks of galleries built by termites of the genus Cubitermes. These networks are extremely sparse, in spite of the fact that there is no building cost associated with higher connectivity. In addition, more ""central"" vertices (in term of betweenness or degree) are preferentially localised at spatial positions far from the external nest walls (more than in a null network model calibrated to exactly the same spatial arrangement of vertices).

We measured the perceived difference in brightness across an edge in the presence of notch filtering and high-pass filtering for two stimulus configurations, one that elicits the perception of transparency and one that appears opaque. For both stimulus configurations, the apparent brightness of the surfaces delimited by the border decreased monotonically with progressive (ideal) high-pass filtering, with a critical cut-off at 1 c/deg. Using two octave ideal notch filtering, the maximum detrimental effect on apparent brightness was observed at about 1 c/deg. Critical frequencies for apparent brightness did not vary with contrast, viewing distance, or surface size, suggesting that apparent brightness is determined by the channel tuned at 1 c/deg. Modelling the data with the local energy model [Morrone, M. C., & Burr, D. C. (1988). Feature detection in human vision: a phase dependent energy model. Proceedings of the Royal Society (London), B235, 221-245] at 1 c/deg confirmed the suggestion that this channel mediates apparent brightness for both opaque and transparent borders, with no need for pooling or integration across spatial channels. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Other visual areas, including primary visual cortex, also respond strongly to the retinotopic location of the edge, but these areas respond equally well to a line of matched contrast and detectability, rather than specifically to the brightness illusion. The reconstruction of surface and/or its brightness seems to be achieved by associative areas from the information about visual features provided by the primary visual cortices, even where there is no physical difference in luminance.
